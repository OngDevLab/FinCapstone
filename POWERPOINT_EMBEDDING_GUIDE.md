# How to Use the Interactive Map in PowerPoint

## ‚ùå PowerPoint CANNOT directly embed interactive HTML

PowerPoint doesn't support embedding live HTML files. However, you have several options:

---

## ‚úÖ OPTION 1: Hyperlink (Recommended for Presentation)

**Best for live presentations**

1. In PowerPoint, insert a screenshot of the globe
2. Add a hyperlink to the HTML file:
   - Right-click the image ‚Üí Hyperlink
   - Link to: `darden_globe_map.html`
3. During presentation, click to open in browser
4. Alt+Tab back to PowerPoint when done

**Pros:** Interactive, impressive, works reliably
**Cons:** Requires switching windows

---

## ‚úÖ OPTION 2: Static Screenshots/GIF

**Best for PDF submissions or non-interactive presentations**

I can create:
1. **Static images** of different globe angles
2. **Animated GIF** rotating the globe
3. **Multiple views** (US, International, by brand)

---

## ‚úÖ OPTION 3: Embed as Object (Workaround)

**Works but clunky**

1. Insert ‚Üí Object ‚Üí Browse
2. Select `darden_globe_map.html`
3. Opens in embedded browser window

**Pros:** Stays in PowerPoint
**Cons:** Limited functionality, may not work on all computers

---

## ‚úÖ OPTION 4: Web-Based Presentation

**Best for remote/online presentations**

1. Upload HTML to a web server or GitHub Pages
2. Share link: `https://yourname.github.io/darden_globe_map.html`
3. Present directly from browser

## üéØ RECOMMENDED APPROACH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION:

### For the Midterm Presentation:

**Slide Setup:**
1. Create a slide titled "Geographic Presence"
2. Insert a screenshot of the globe (I can generate this)
3. Add text: "Click to view interactive map ‚Üí"
4. Hyperlink the image to `darden_globe_map.html`

**During Presentation:**
1. Click the image
2. Browser opens with interactive globe
3. Rotate to show US concentration
4. Zoom to show international locations
5. Toggle brands on/off to show distribution
6. Alt+Tab back to PowerPoint

### For the PDF Submission:

Use static images showing:
1. Full globe view
2. US close-up
3. International locations highlighted
4. Brand distribution comparison
