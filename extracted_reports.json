Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joinin g me are Rick \nCardenas, Darden's President and CEO, and Raj Vennam, CFO. As a reminder, comments made during this call \nwill include forward -looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These \nstatements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our \nexpectations and projections. Those risks are described in the company's press release, which was distributed \nthis morning and in its filings with the Securities and E xchange Commission.  \n \nWe are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations \nsection of our website at darden.com.

All reference to t he industry's results refer to \nBlack Box Intelligence casual dining benchmark excluding Darden. During our fiscal first quarter, average same -\nrestaurant sales for the industry grew 5% and average same -restaurant guest count grew 2.6%. Additionally, due \nto the continued divergence between average and median results, we are sharing that median same -restaurant \nsales for the industry grew 3.3% and median same -restaurant guest count grew 1.3%.  \n \nThis morning, Rick will share some brief remarks on the quarter, and  Raj will provide details on our first quarter \nand share our updated fiscal 2026 financial outlook. Now, I will turn the call over to Rick.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  \nThank you, Courtney, and  good morning, everyone. We had a great quarter with same -restaurant sales and \nearnings growth that exceeded our expectations for the first quarter. Three of our four segments generated \npositive same -restaurant sales and traffic growth. The strength of our  results is a testament to the power of our \nstrategy.  \n \nAcross our portfolio, our restaurant teams remain focused on being brilliant with the basics through culinary \ninnovation and execution, attentive service, and an engaging atmosphere, all enabled by our  people. And at the \nDarden level, we continue to strengthen and leverage our four competitive advantages of significant scale, \nextensive data and insights, rigorous strategic planning, and the quality of our employees to further position our \nbrands for lon g-term success.  \n Darden Restaurants, Inc.  (DRI) \nQ1 2026 Earnings Call  Corrected Transcript  \n18-Sep-2025   \n \n1-877-FACTSET   www.callstreet.com   4 \nCopyright \u00a9 2001 -2025  FactSet  CallStreet, LLC  \n \nOlive Garden's same -restaurant sales grew 5.9%, driven by compelling food news and the continued growth of \nfirst-party delivery. Early in the quarter, Olive Garden's marketing highlighted their Create Your Own Pasta \nplatform from the core menu. Their television creative featured a new spicy three -meat sauce and bucatini pasta \nstarting at $12.99. This new sauce taps into guests' evolving tastes for bolder, more flavorful offerings. It was well \nreceived and helped drive a significant increase  in preference for the Create Your Own Pasta platform.  \n \nOlive Garden built on the momentum of bold and spicy flavors by debuting Calabrian steak and shrimp bucatini \nfor a limited time during the quarter. The dish exceeded expectations and quickly became a new guest favorite, \nranking among the top 10 entr\u00e9es for preference.  \n \nFirst-party delivery through our partnership with Uber Direct is helping capture younger, more affluent guests who \nvalue convenience and crave Olive Garden. This represents a significant  incremental opportunity for the brand as \nthese guests have a higher check average and typically do not use Olive Garden for an in -restaurant dining \noccasion. Olive Garden's advertising featuring 1 million free deliveries concluded in the first quarter wit h all the \nfree deliveries being redeemed. Average weekly deliveries doubled throughout the campaign.  \n \nFollowing the campaign, delivery order volume has remained approximately 40% above the pre -campaign \naverage. The team will continue to promote delivery ac ross a number of channels. On our last call, we talked \nabout putting a greater emphasis on sales growth and reinvesting to drive long -term growth. One of the ways we \nare doing this at Olive Garden is by strengthening affordability on the menu to give guest s more variety at \napproachable price points.  \n \nDuring the quarter, Olive Garden began testing a lighter portion section of the menu, featuring seven of their \nexisting entr\u00e9es with reduced portions and a reduced price. These items, available at dinner and al l-day during \nthe weekend, still offer abundant portions and come with Olive Garden's never -ending first course of unlimited \nbreadsticks and unlimited soup or salad. 40% of Olive Garden restaurants currently offer this menu, and the initial \nresponse from gu ests has been encouraging. With affordability scores increasing 15 percentage points and high \nsatisfaction with portion size. I have confidence in Olive Garden's initiatives for the year, as well as their five -year \nroadmap to sustain long -term growth and s uccess.  \n \nLongHorn Steakhouse grew same -restaurant sales by 5.5%, driven by continued adherence to their strategy \nrooted in quality, simplicity, and culture. The team continues to raise the bar in food quality by consistently \nexecuting every dish on their m enu to their high standards. This is reflected by LongHorn's number one ranking \namong casual dining brands \u2013 major casual dining brands within Technomic's industry tracking tool for food \nquality, service, atmosphere, and value. I'm really proud of the oper ational consistency at LongHorn and the work \nthe team is doing to maintain their momentum.  \n \nSame -restaurant sales for our Other Business segment grew 3.3% during the quarter, driven by strong \nperformance at Yard House, Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen, and Season s 52. During the quarter, Yard House \nstrengthened their competitive advantage of distinctive culinary offerings with broad appeal by enhancing their \ntaco platform with higher quality ingredients and more options for guests. As they have seen with similar \ninvestments in their burger and pizza platforms, this resulted in higher preference and guest satisfaction.  \n \nTo help strengthen their competitive advantage of a socially energized bar, Yard House held its third annual Best \nOn Tap competition during the quar ter. What began as a test of knowledge and hospitality skills has grown into a \ncornerstone of the Yard House culture where every bartender competes. Congratulations to this year's winner, \nMichelle Yanez, from the Yard House at CityCentre in Houston, Texas.  \n Darden Restaurants, Inc.

During the quarter, they introduced a Hawaiian Sirloin, a center -cut top sirloin finished with \npineapple and a sweet Hawaiian glaze, starting at $16.49. This limited time offer also included a honey butter \ncroissant and two sides for that price.  \n \nIn Technomic's most recent survey, Cheddar's ranked first among casual dining brands for both price and \naffordability. During the quarter, Cheddar's also saw strong off -premise sales growth driven by first -party delivery. \nOff-premise sales grew 15% during the quarter, and the Cheddar's team will continue to promote delivery through \nowned and digital channels, as well as in -restau rant. \n \nSame -restaurant sales for the Fine Dining segment were slightly negative for the quarter, but I'm encouraged by \nthe actions each of our Fine Dining brands are taking to address the softness. For example, in the current \nenvironment, more guests are s eeking price certainty, and Ruth's Chris Steak House introduced a five -week \nlimited time offer featuring a three -course menu that drove positive comps for the quarter. For $55, guests could \nselect one of three entr\u00e9es, as well as a super salad, an individu al side, and dessert. The offer was well received \nwith strong guest preference and sales lift.  \n \nNow, I want to share a quick update on the sale of eight Olive Garden locations in Canada that I referenced \nduring our last call. On July 14, we closed on the s ale of those locations to Recipe Unlimited, the largest full -\nservice operator in Canada. At closing, we also entered into an area development agreement with Recipe \nUnlimited to open 30 more Olive Gardens over the next 10 years, 5 of which have already been  approved. Our \nfranchising team is focused on growing our global presence. Today, we have 163 franchised locations, which \nincludes 63 in the continental United States and 100 outside of continental US.  \n \nLast month, we held our annual leadership conference,  which provides a powerful way for us to engage with \nevery general manager and managing partner across our brands, celebrate past performance, and align on key \noperational priorities. This was also an opportunity for these restaurant leaders to learn about  their brand's five -\nyear business plan and understand what they need to do to win today and into 2030. The opportunity to interact \nwith this talented group of operators is one of the highlights of the year. I came away energized by the level of \nengagement and passion on display, which further reinforced the results of our most recent engagement survey. \nA new all -time high for Darden.  \n \nOverall, I am pleased with the strong start to our new fiscal year. Our strategy is working, enabling us to grow \nsales and t ake market share while meaningful \u2013 making meaningful investments in our business and returning \ncapital to our shareholders. Beyond that, we have a larger purpose at Darden to nourish and delight everyone we \nserve. One of the ways we do this is by fighting  hunger.  \n \nOnce again, this year, Darden is helping Feeding America add refrigerated trucks for nine member food banks. \nWith the addition of these new trucks, the Darden Foundation, with support from our partner, Penske Truck \nLeasing, has funded more than 5 0 vehicles to meet the increasing demand for food assistance and communities \nwhere we operate. Our philanthropic giving would not be possible without the efforts of our 200,000 team \nmembers and their passion to nourish and delight our guests and communitie s. Thank you for all you do.  \n \nNow, I'll turn it over to Raj.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRajesh Vennam  \nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  Darden Restaurants, Inc.  (DRI) \nQ1 2026 Earnings Call  Corrected Transcript  \n18-Sep-2025   \n \n1-877-FACTSET   www.callstreet.com   6 \nCopyright \u00a9 2001 -2025  FactSet  CallStreet, LLC  \n \nThank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter was another strong quarter for Darden. Sales and \nearnings growth exceeded our expectations, as our sales momentum from the fourth quarter continued into the \nfirst quarter. This strong top line sales growth and our significant scale provide us with the opportunity to keep a \nlong-term perspective  and continue investing in our business.  \n \nIn addition to the menu investments that Rick mentioned, the largest investment we made over the past several \nyears is pricing below total inflation. During the first quarter, our pricing was 30 basis points below inflation. We \ngenerated $3 billion of total sales, 10% higher than last year, driven by same -restaurant sales growth of 4.7%, the \nacquisition of 103 Chuy's restaurants, and the addition of 22 net new restaurants.  \n \nBoth our same -restaurant sales and same -restaurant guest counts for the quarter were in the top quartile of the \nindustry. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.97 were 12.6% higher than last \nyear. We generated $439 million of adjusted EBITDA and returned $358 mil lion to our shareholders this quarter \nby paying $175 million in dividends and repurchasing $183 million in shares.  \n \nNow, looking at our adjusted margin analysis compared to last year, food and beverage expenses were 20 basis \npoints lower, driven by pricing  leverage as commodities inflation was approximately 1.5% for the quarter. \nRestaurant labor was 20 basis points unfavorable as a result of high performance -based compensation expense, \nincluding a higher 401(k) match for our restaurant teams. Total labor in flation of 3.1% was fully offset by pricing of \n2.2% and productivity improvements.  \n \nRestaurant expenses were 20 bps \u2013 10 basis points higher, as sales leverage was more than offset by Uber \nDirect fees and the brand mix with the addition of Chuy's. Marketin g expenses were flat as cost savings in \nmarketing helped fund additional marketing activity in the quarter. This resulted in restaurant level EBITDA of \n18.9%, 10 basis points lower than last year.  \n \nAdjusted G&A expenses were 30 basis points favorable. Syne rgies from the acquisition and leverage from sales \ngrowth were partially offset by unfavorable mark -to-market expense on our deferred compensation. Due to the \nway we hedge mark -to-market expense, this unfavorability is fully offset in the tax line. Interes t expense increased \n10 basis points due to the financing expenses related to the Chuy's acquisition.  \n \nOur adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 10.5%, helped by the mark -to-market hedge I mentioned \nearlier. Our effective tax rate would have been approximately 12.5% without this impact. In total, we generated \n$231 million in adjusted earnings from continuing operations, which was 7.6% of sales.  \n \nLooking at our segments for the quarter, total sales for Olive Garden increased by 7.6%, driven by stron g same -\nrestaurant sales and traffic growth. The sales from the addition of 18 new restaurants more than offset the sales \nloss from the re -franchising of 8 Canadian restaurants. Their sales momentum continued from the prior quarter, \nwith same -restaurant sal es in the top decile of the industry and outperforming their industry benchmark by 90 \nbasis points. Olive Garden delivered a strong segment profit margin of 20.6% for the quarter, which was only 10 \nbasis points below last year, even with the investments in  affordability and the impact of delivery fees.  \n \nAt LongHorn, total sales increased 8.8%, driven by same -restaurant sales growth of 5.5% and the addition of 18 \nnew restaurants. The sustained sales and traffic outperformance resulted in same -restaurant sale s in the top \nquartile of the industry for the 13th consecutive quarter, with this quarter ranking in the top decile. The LongHorn \nteam is doing a great job of staying focused on their strategy and maintaining momentum within the business \ndespite continued cost pressures. Higher than expected beef costs towards the end of the quarter and pricing Darden Restaurants, Inc.

While \nsame -restaurant sales for the segment were slightly negative, the strong performance of the limited time offer at \nRuth's Chris helped to offset the continued challenges withi n the Fine Dining category. Overall, segment profit \nmargin was lower than last year.  \n \nThe Other Business segment sales increased 22.5% with the acquisition of Chuy's and positive same -restaurant \nsales of 3.3%. The positive sales momentum and continued productivity improvements in multiple brands within \nthe segment resulted in segment profit margin of 16.1%, 90 basis points higher than last year.  \n \nNow, turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2026. This morning, we updated a few items in our guidance,  taking \ninto consideration actual performance year -to-date and the evolving commodities outlook for the remainder of the \nfiscal year. We are raising our expected total sales growth and tightening the range of same -restaurant sales to \nreflect the outperform ance in the first quarter, acceleration in our new unit pipeline, and any incremental pricing \nwe may take to partially offset the additional commodities costs.  \n \nWe now expect total sales growth of \u2013 for the year of 7.5% to 8.5%, same -restaurant sales growt h of 2.5% to \n3.5%, approximately 65 new restaurant openings, and total inflation of 3 -point \u2013 3% to 3.5%, with commodities \ninflation of 3% to 4%. All other aspects of our guidance remain unchanged, including adjusted diluted net earnings \nper share between $10.50 and $10.70.  \n \nWhile we are reiterating our full year earnings per share guidance, we expect the lowest year -over-year EPS \ngrowth to be in the second quarter, driven by the significant step -up in beef costs and our measured approach to \npricing for the se costs. We expect our pricing for the second quarter to be approximately 100 basis points below \ntotal inflation.  \n \nWe have a proven track record of successfully navigating through higher costs, and we'll continue to take a \ndisciplined approach to ensure t he long -term health of our business. We believe our strategy remains the right \none for our company. Now, we'll take your questions.  \n  Darden Restaurants, Inc.

And I'll be conducting a question -and-answer session. As a reminder, w e ask you to \nplease ask one question and one follow -up, then return to the queue. [Operator Instructions] And we ask you to \nplease ask one question and one follow -up, then return to the queue. Our first question today is coming from \nBrian Harbour from Morg an Stanley. Your line is now live.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nBrian Harbour  \nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \nYeah. Good morning, guys. Maybe just on that last point first, Raj. Could you talk about sort of contracting \nthrough the balance of the year and sort of what gives you visibility that you've kind of encompassed the range of \nfood cost outcomes?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRajesh Vennam  \nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah, Brian, I think if you look at what we published this morning, we \u2013 our coverage i s less than typical, \nespecially in beef. Right now, we only have about 25% coverage in beef for the next six months, and that's one of \nthe biggest opportunities in terms of where we're seeing the biggest headwinds. And I think, as you all know, \nthere has b een a significant spike in beef costs recently, especially tenders and ribeye. So \u2013 and we don't believe \nthese price levels are sustainable, and that's why we don't have as much coverage, and that's part of the reason.  \n \nAnd given the significant price incr ease, there are \u2013 we are starting to see some demand destruction in retail. So, \nI guess, really, the big picture, beef is the biggest variable here. And then, the other component here where you're \nseeing a higher inflation is on seafood, primarily due to t he tariffs on shrimp, and our team is working through to \nfigure out how to mitigate some of that. And that's really the reason why we're taking the inflation up from 2.5% at \nthe beginning of the year to now 3% to 4%. But this situation is still very fluid here.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nBrian Harbour  \nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \nOkay. Understood. Thanks. Rick, maybe just on the comments about sort of these \u2013 the new portion sizes at \nOlive Garden. What's \u2013 are you seeing sort of a different guest that is asking for that? Do  you think this is actually \nsort of a traffic driver for Olive Garden or, I guess, on the other hand, do you think this is check dilutive in some \nsense? Like how are people actually sort of approaching that? What are you seeing from [ph] those items \n(00:21 :43)?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah, Brian, it's still pretty early. We do believe, in the long run, this is a traffic driver. It will dilute our check a li ttle \nbit, as \u2013 if people trade from a higher portion size item to a lower portion size item, but we believe that's the \nportion that those guests want. And its very early indications are that we're seeing a little bit more frequency, but \nit's not necessarily new guests because we haven't  marketed it and we've put it in restaurant without even any \nfanfare, and it's just people are gravitating towards that. It's not significant preference gravitating towards it, but \nthere is some preference moving there.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....

Next question is coming from Jon Tower from Citi. Your line is now live.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nJon Tower  \nAnalyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.  Q \nRight. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe kind of in the same vein, that  \u2013 the affordability pivot and this \nquarter, as well as the Uber Eats amplification or build in the quarter. Can you maybe speak to how that hit on the \ncost line during the period? And I noticed that, obviously, the restaurant margin, you didn't lever that  as much on a \npretty solid comp in the period. So, maybe perhaps you could speak to those costs during the period and what \nyou're expecting going forward as well?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRajesh Vennam  \nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah, Jon, let me first start by saying, these are things we planned on and we had in our plan. And I think we \nsaid, that's why we said we're actually exceeding our plan. And it's actually \u2013 the fact that the segment profit \nmargin is only down 10%, they're  still north of 20%, is a testament to the strength of the business model at Olive \nGarden.  \n \nNow, with that said, when \u2013 let me explain a little bit more detail. First of all, we still priced below total inflation. \nOlive Garden's pricing was only 1.9%, so t hat's a pretty low price in this environment, given the, again, the total \ninflation. Second, specific to those two items, they were roughly on the margin. If you just purely look at the \nmargin percentage impact, they're probably about 20 basis points each.  \n \nSo, if you put that back, I mean, we would have been positive 30%, right, but that's, again, even with pricing below \ninflation. So, I think that's the sort of key metric that we need to take into consideration because we believe, long \nterm, these are the  right decisions we're making. And I think any business would envy a 20 -plus percent segment \nprofit margin.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nJon Tower  \nAnalyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.  Q \nGot it. I appreciate that. And then, maybe just drilling a little bit more into the delivery business at Olive Garden, \ncan you talk about, Rick, you had mentioned that you're pleased with how obviously you're seeing younger guests \nmake their way in, more affluent. Can you give us any more information on the frequency of those guests? Are \nthey comi ng more so than what you're seeing within the store in terms of frequency and how they're using it even \n\u2013 obviously, it hasn't been a year yet \u2013 but seasonally, how they're maybe using that channel relative to in -store?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah. Jon, we've said in \u2013 as we said in the past, we are getting higher frequency for delivery guests than we are \nin dining guests. It's still early. We haven't had the delivery for a year yet, as you mentioned. As to seasonality, \nthe one thing that Uber told us is, normally, over the summer, delivery orders start to kind of fall off, and we really \nhadn't seen that.  \n Darden Restaurants, Inc.

That said, we're very excited about how delivery is going. And as Raj \nmentioned earlier, we are using some of that extra guest count and extra margin to invest for all guests, and we \nfeel really good about that for the long term.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nJon Tower  \nAnalyst, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

Good morning. Aside from the beef cost question, I think there's probably two areas that are major areas \nof curiosity, and I certainly share them. And one is, the strong performance of the casual dining segment , which is \nbecoming increasingly unusual after fast casual, has slowed through the year through the middle of this year. And \nanother, I think, is Olive Garden against more difficult comparisons later in your fiscal year, how will it do and what \nare you lin ing up against that? So, those are really my two questions. What are your thoughts about why casual \ndining is doing as well and do you think that'll continue?  \n \nAnd then, separately, Olive Garden, you're rolling out a pretty large test on small portions but  what are your \nthoughts and what are you kind of lining up to keep the momentum going as you get into lapping some of the \ngood stuff you're do \u2013 you've been doing the last three or four months? Thanks.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah, David. The \u2013 I believe the strong casual dining segment is driven by, generally, less pricing than other \nsegments of dining for the segment itself, for casual dining itself. And for the larger players in casual  dining, even \nlower pricing than casual dining in total. So, there is a \u2013 the guests are starting to see the value that casual dining \nbrings.  \n \nNow, we've been seeing that for a few years now, as you know, and just others are kind of following in line with \nthat and we're seeing that the guests see the value. Also, when they're trying to figure out where they spend their \nmoney, they're going to places where they can connect and engage with their friends and family. There may be \nless snacking going on and less  kind of munching, but when people are going out to eat, they're going out to \nwhere they can feel they can get a great meal at a great value and have time with their friends.  \n \nIn regards to Olive Garden for the back half of the year, we have plans to conti nue the momentum. We do know \nthat the comparisons get a little bit more challenging, but the Olive Garden team is working on things that we \ncould do in the back half of the year. We've got a great plan. We do believe that, over time, the affordability item s \non the menu, the lighter portion \u2013 I don't want to call them affordability, they're the right portion size for the right \nprice for a group of consumers, that will eventually drive more traffic. It might not drive it in the back half of the \nyear because w e're not talking about it yet.  \n \nThat said, we may start talking about it in the back half of the year. So, there's a lot of things that we're going to \ndo. We've got a great team. And we'll react to whatever the sales trends look like at Olive Garden, and w e'll go \nfrom there.

Your line is now live.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nJim Salera  \nAnalyst, Stephens, Inc.  Q \nHey, Rick. Hey, Raj. Good morning. Thanks for  taking our question. Was hoping you could give us a breakdown \non LongHorn, just the comp split between traffic and ticket. And then, as a follow -up on that, have you seen any \nincreased engagement with consumer? You mentioned, obviously, pricing 100 basis points below inflation. \nShould we kind of expect that similar gap to progress through the year, or any thoughts around how we should \nexpect pricing to trend? Thank you.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRajesh Vennam  \nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Darden Restaurants, In c. A \nYeah. So, let's \u2013 I'll start with the LongHorn. Traffic was \u2013 LongHorn traffic was up about 3.2% for the quarter. \nTheir same -restaurant sales were 5.5%, so the check was [ph] 2.3% (00:29:57). Their pricing was 2.5%. They \nhad a little bit of a negativ e mix primarily of about \u2013 of 20 basis points. In terms of pricing versus inflation, at \nLongHorn, as we said, we \u2013 there was a bigger spike in beef prices. There was a little bit of a surprise at the end \nof the quarter, but we also had planned on having so me gap to pricing, so it further widened, I guess, by the time \nwe ended the quarter a little bit.  \n \nAs we look through the year, we expect second quarter at the Darden level \u2013 without getting specific segment \nlevels here. At the Darden level, we expect pric ing to be about 100 basis points below inflation, and we expect \nthat gap to narrow as we go through the year. And so, you would expect the pressures on the margin to be \u2013 kind \nof follow that, right. So, we probably have the biggest gap in Q2, maybe cut tha t in half by the time you get to Q3, \nand then try to narrow that further as we get to Q4.  \n \nBut consistent with our philosophy, our pricing for the full year will probably be \u2013 will end up being below inflation. \nIs it going to be [ph] 30 or 50 basis points (00:31:10)? I don't know, we're working through that. I think our \u2013 we've \nbeen always very thoughtful about what cost do we actually price for? And we don't want to price for temporary \ncosts, we want to price for \u2013 over time, find other ways to solve for t hese incremental costs. And that's what our \nteam is focused on.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nJim Salera  \nAnalyst, Stephens, Inc.  Q \nGreat. And then, you guys mentioned the value -focused menu expansion at Olive Garden. Is that something that \nwe could see maybe in a more limited fashion at LongHorn as well, maybe focused on like appetizers or smaller \nplate items? Or is that something that right now is just Olive Garden focused?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nWe're usin g \u2013 we're doing this at Olive Garden to see how that works out. And if other brands think that it makes \nsense for them and they get the learnings from Olive Garden, maybe they will implement. But right now, the focus \nis the Olive Garden, and it's the Olive  Garden team that's driving it. And as I said, we'll see how that goes. Now, Darden Restaurants, Inc.

Next question is coming from Eric Gonzalez from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is \nnow live.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nEric Gonzalez  \nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.  Q \nHi. Thanks for taking the question. Just a few quarters ago, you talked about some strength among the lower \nincome consumers. And obviously, most of your peers, particularly on the fast food side, are talking about \nweakness among that cohort of income. So, if you maybe you coul d talk about what you're seeing from an income \nperspective, and are you gaining share among lower income consumers? Do you think that part of the equation is \nactually holding your sales up relative to your peers? And are you seeing some maybe trade into th e category \nfrom some of the higher income folks, particularly on the casual dining side?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah, Eric. Specific to casual dining, all our casual dining brands saw a n increase in visits year -over-year from \nguests across all income groups, but specifically those in higher income groups. So, you would expect that that \nwould have been \u2013 that could have been some trade down, but it could be trade up from the lower income groups \nto a great value in casual dining.  \n \nWe are seeing a few shifts in behavior in that guests are going towards what price certainty, so they know what \nthey're going to pay before they come in or greater perceived value, even if the item is a high price . So, if you \nthink about the Calabrian steak and shrimp that we had at Olive Garden, great preference, great perceived value, \nit was the highest priced menu item on the menu. So \u2013 but we are seeing, as I said, for casual dining brands, \ngrowth among all inc ome groups.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nEric Gonzalez  \nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.  Q \nGreat. And then, on the \u2013 just to close the loop on the commodity discussion, based on where the commodities \nare now and what you've locked in, I know you're a little bit lighter on the beef side, what do you think that implies \nfor store level margins and what's embedded in the guidance? In the past, you talked about modest margin \nexpansion. Do you still think you can get there based on what you did in the first quarter and where you are \nlocked in?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRajesh Vennam  \nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nEric, I would refer you back to our long -term framework, which basically talks about our earnings after tax from 0 \nto 20 basis points growth. So, if you  look at our guidance, even at the low end, we're basically either flat or \ngrowing margin at the EAT level. We don't want to focus too much on any one line item. And for us, ultimately, if \nwe're able to achieve our long -term framework and get the targets w e want to get to by investing more in the Darden Restaurants, Inc.

If that means that the segment profit margins are down year -over-year, that's not \nsomething we're concerned about. I think our focus, ultimately, is on, at the EAT level, at the earnings after tax \nlevel, are we staying flat or growing margins. And that's \u2013 we feel like we're still on a path to get there.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nEric Gonzalez  \nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.

Next question today is coming from Da vid Tarantino from Baird. Your line is now live.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nDavid E. Tarantino  \nAnalyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.  Q \nHi. Good morning. Rick, I had a question about your views on the overall health of the consumer spending \nenvironment. Certainly, you had a great quarter, but I guess over the last few months we've seen a lot of \ncrosscurrents related to the jobs updates and whatnot. So, I'm just maybe wanting to get your thoughts on where \nwe are from the state of consumer spending, and whether you think anything's c hanged recently relative to maybe \nwhere you thought it was at the start of the year?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah, David. I can't say that anything's changed dramatically from where we s aw it the start of the year. We are \nahead of where we thought we'd be right now. There's a lot of talk about the job revisions, but those jobs didn't \nexist. So, that's what the \u2013 that's what people were working. And so, we're dealing with what was actually  \nhappening, not what was thought to be happening. And so, I believe that August retail sales were up pretty \nsignificantly, and we had a pretty darn good August, too. So, I don't see any dramatic change to what we thought \nthe consumer was.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nDavid E. Tarant ino \nAnalyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.  Q \nGreat. That's helpful. And Raj, one quick clarification. You mentioned the inflation versus pricing gap is expected \nto narrow as you get into maybe the second half of the year. Is that because the price component's going higher \nor the inflation component's coming down? I guess, could you explain kind of how that might work?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRajesh Vennam  \nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah, sure, David. It's primarily that w e are taking a little bit more price as we go through the year. We mentioned \nthat at the beginning of the year, right? We started pretty low in the first quarter. We expect to get, for the full year, \nto be in the mid - to high -2s. And we started with 2.2%. As you can see, as the year progresses, that moves up a \nlittle bit. And then, there's also some near -term pressures that we expect because, like I said on the commentary \naround beef, we don't think some of these high prices are sustainable. I mean, these a re pretty punitive to the \nconsumer, and we're trying to protect them by not pricing for it.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nDavid E. Tarantino  \nAnalyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.  Q \nMakes sense.

Next question is coming from Sara Senatore fr om Bank of America. Your line is now live.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nSara H. Senatore  \nAnalyst, BofA Securities, Inc.  Q \nGreat. Thank you. I wanted to ask about the idea of sort of investing and growing top line, more of a top line \ndriven growth algorithm. You mentioned pricing below inflation. Obviously, affordability is something that your \nbrands are known for in terms of value for the money. But, I guess, I could also characterize marketing as a way \nto do that or even perhaps subsidizing delivery fees? So, I was just curious, as you think about the kind of \ndifferent investments, is marketing something? I know you said you got some leverage here, so marketing dollars \nwere higher, though perhaps a little bit [ph] light (00:38:44) of what we might have expected.  \n \nAnd you talked ab out delivery fees as perhaps margin pressure. So, I wasn't sure if that's because you're not fully \ncovering them with what you charge your customers, but perhaps you could \u2013 and I know it's free delivery this \nquarter, so perhaps that's an exception. But ma ybe you could talk a little bit about, as you think about investing \nbehind top line, these other possible ways to do that? And then, I do have another quick follow -up. \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, In c. A \nYeah. Sara, we do believe that marketing can help drive traffic. And while our marketing as a percent of sales \ndidn't seem to grow, I think Raj mentioned in the prepared remarks, we had some cost saves in marketing that \noffset our actual marketing gr owth. So, we actually had more TRPs out there. Our other brands that are not on \nlinear TV are testing connected television and other digital aspects. Cheddar's had their first ever 30 -secondnd \ncommercial on a connected television.  \n \nSo, we are increasing ou r marketing activity because we believe that that will drive some traffic, but we're not \ndoing it at deep discounting in the ways that we had done it in the past. The \u2013 and you did already \u2013 I think you \nanswered your question on the delivery fees. There ar e other ways that we can do things to drive delivery. But \nthis quarter, the 1 million free deliveries did impact a little bit of the margin.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nSara H. Senatore  \nAnalyst, BofA Securities, Inc.  Q \nGreat. Thank you. And then, just the follow -up was, I think you alluded to less snacking or munching. I was \ncurious, is that like a GLP -1 reference in terms of like how people are changing their eating patterns, or it was \nmore people are prepared to give up some of these sort of convenience or impulse occasions and  spend behind \nreally good experiences like they get at Olive Garden or LongHorn or your other brands.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nSara, I think it's a little bit of both. There are some peop le on GLP -1 that, when you do the research on them, they \neat smaller portions or they eat out a little less, but when they eat out, they actually eat out more in casual dining. \nAnd so, there is a little bit of that. But I think it's maybe even a consumer t hat says, I'm just trying to be healthier \nor eat a little less. And so, maybe there is a little less snacking. And at the lower end consumer, they probably \ndon't have as much resource to go out as much as they did and it's probably impacting another catego ry more \nthan it is impacting us.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nSara H.

Next question today is coming from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is now live.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nJeffrey A. Bernstein  \nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.  Q \nGreat. Thank you very much. Rick, for fiscal 2026, you raised your comp guide modestly, but clearly that's in spite \nof maybe what many people expect is a slightly tougher macro and concerns about consumer slowdown and we \nknow about the tougher compares. I think you mentioned the first quarter was modestly above your plan. But any \ncolor you could share on your confidence in raising that guide?  \n \nAnd as we think about the current fiscal 2Q, the compares are definitely much to ugher. And the last quarter, you \nwere willing to frame kind of what you expected for the current quarter versus your full year guide, wondering \nwhether you think the fiscal second quarter will come in above or below kind of that new range? And then, I had \none follow -up. \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah. Jeff, I'll start by saying we wouldn't have increased our guidance if we didn't feel confident about it. So, as \nwe look at our same -restauran t sales and our total sales, part of the reason we raised our total sales is we're \nreally confident in our unit count in development. We increased the number of \u2013 well, we got rid of the low end of \nour range for development. And we say, now, we're approxim ately 65, partly because we are \u2013 most of the \nrestaurants are either built or being built or open already, and some of them are coming in earlier than we \nthought. So, we feel really good about our development pipeline. And I'll let Raj talk about the caden ce of our \ncomp, but for the second quarter and beyond.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRajesh Vennam  \nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah, Jeff. I'd say, look, we expected as we get [ph] back into (00:43:13) the year for the back half to be not as \nstrong in comps as the first half. But I think, as the year is progressing, we're learning more and we feel really \ngood about how even the second quarter started off, and that's all taken into consideration as we provided this \nguidance. But I think,  ultimately, the cadence will still be the fact that we still expect the back half to be lower than \nthe first half.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nJeffrey A. Bernstein  \nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.  Q \nUnderstood. And then, just to follow -up on your Uber partnership, I know it is sti ll early, but it seems like you're \nhaving success with Olive Garden and Cheddar's with the 1P. I'm just wondering, first, whether you'd consider a \nnext brand to embrace that 1P Uber delivery, and whether there's any updated thoughts on potential for using \nUber for the order aggregation part of things, not just delivery? Thank you.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah. Jeff, we are pleased with our first -party delivery both at Olive Garden and at Cheddar's. It continues to grow \nfor us. We do have another brand that's wanting to embrace it, and we would expect that brand to be on the Darden Restaurants, Inc.

Won't tell you what brand that is, but they're very excited to jump into the first -party \ndelivery.  \n \nAs \u2013 in regards to marketplace or third -party, whether it's Uber or anyone else, we still have some challenges with \nthe model. We're focused on first -party right now, and we've talked about the things that we don't like about third -\nparty.

I gues s, I first wanted to double back on unit growth acceleration over like medium - to long -\nterm. I know you took away the lower end. Just how should we think about that ramping up, especially with \u2013 I \nknow there's some new prototypes, there's some acceleration  in Canada, and a couple moving parts.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah. The development is our owned restaurants, so 65 of our restaurants. Canada is all franchised, so that \ndoesn't count in our unit growth. We get a lot of good royalties from that but that doesn't \u2013 isn't a unit for us. In \nregards to how we're going to ramp up our five -year plan [ph] passes (00:46:03) solidly in our long -term \nframework of 3% to 4% of our sales growth comin g from new units. And so, you would expect our unit growth \npercentage to ramp up a little bit year -over-year.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nJacob Aiken -Phillips  \nAnalyst, Melius Research LLC  Q \nGreat. And then, just on \u2013 I know that there was like some prototypes of like smaller, but then also some \ncompetitors are saying they're seeing some higher construction costs from like imported stuff. Any comments \nthere?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah, we've got a couple of brands. Actually, all of our brands, especially Olive Garden and LongHorn, over years \nworked on the right prototype size. Yard House and Cheddar's have just come out with new prototypes that are \nsmaller, much more efficient, and the costs are lower than it  would be for building an \u2013 our existing prototype -\nsized restaurants. And we've opened a few of them and they're doing really well, and they're able to generate the \nsales that our existing prototypes are generating in general. In regards to costs, our cost s are much closer and \nactually sometimes under our budgeted amounts, which is very different than it was before. Tariff impacts, we \ndon't believe are too dramatic to construction costs. And so, we feel really confident about our pipeline and being \nable to build them at a very good return for us.

Q \nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. My first one is on delivery. I'm hoping you can frame the mix the delivery \nwas in the first quarter, but also what the exit rate was after the promotion? Also, whether you expect to promot e \nsimilar promotions in the \u2013 as we go forward in 2026? And then, I have a follow -up. \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah. Jake, I'll speak specifically to Olive Garden. I think that's what you're asking for. So, for Olive Garden, \ndelivery in the first quarter was about 5%. We exited at about 4%. As we mentioned, when we stopped the million \nfree deliveries, we exited a little bit lower, but still 40% above where we were before the promotion. I think that \nwas your question [indiscernible] (00:48:37)?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nJake Rowland Bartlett  \nAnalyst, Truist Securities, Inc.

Oh, and whether you expect to do a similar promotion...  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Offic er & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nOh. \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nJake Rowland Bartlett  \nAnalyst, Truist Securities, Inc.

Q \n...yeah?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nSorry. Yeah, I don't know if we may do another million free deliveries. I don't know. But we do have marketing \nfunds that that Uber gives us based on our volume. And so, we're going to utilize those somehow, whether it's \nmillion free deliveries or doing something different, we will utilize those funds.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....

Q \nGot it. A nd in terms of the never -ending pasta bowl promotion I think timed similar to last year. I'm wondering, you \nmade a comment about consumers really gravitating towards price certainty, some momentum in August. I'm \nwondering whether you can comment on how you  expect never -ending pasta bowl to perform this year versus \nlast? And maybe how it is performing, whether it's particularly resonating with consumers right now?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah. I will say that never -ending pasta bowl is off to a good start for us. It's really at the center of Olive Garden's \ncore equity of never -ending craveable, abundant Italian food. And preference is up versus last year. And the team \nis doing an amazing j ob ensuring that guests get refills. So, the refill rate is way up. So, I think guests are \nunderstanding that promotion more and more as we brought it back, and they really understand the value that it \nbrings. And I will say that the performance to -date is  in our guidance.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nJake Rowland Bartlett  \nAnalyst, Truist Securities, Inc.

Your line is now live.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nPeter Saleh  \nAnalyst, BTIG LLC  Q \nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just one question on the beef situation. Can you elaborate a little bit \nmore on maybe what's driving it higher in the near term or more recently? And why do you think this is not \nsustainable? And then, just more specifically, if these prices are sustained or maybe even go higher, would you \ntake a little bit more price at LongHorn in the back end of the year? Just trying to understand the strategy there, if \nthe beef prices actually go a little higher from here.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRajesh Vennam  \nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah. Peter, let's just start with the dynamics, right. Right now, supply is constrained from a few things. One, \nthere have been some packer cutbacks, and also Mexican cattle impo rts have been halted because of the \nscrewworm outbreak. So, those are kind of the drivers of the supply constraint. In addition to that, tariffs on Brazil \nare causing a significant reduction in beef imports into the US. So, that's also creating a constrain t. So, those are \non the supply side.  \n \nThe part of the reason we don't believe that kind of price increase, especially double -digit price increases, we're \nseeing are not sustainable is because the consumer can't afford these. And over time there will be som e \u2013 there \nshould be some demand destruction. And also, the amount of cattle on feed has actually been fairly consistent \nmonth -to-month. And at some point, these cattle have to be \u2013 have to go to \u2013 put to work, I guess.  \n \nSo, those are the reasons of how we think about where the prices might go. Who knows exactly? We don't know, \nwe're just \u2013 but we're a lot more open for those reasons. Now, as we think about what would we do, yeah, if these \nprices \u2013 if prices stay very high, that means that the demand is also  very high, which means we should be able to Darden Restaurants, Inc.

We're not \u2013 that's not our preferred path, but if the dynamics lead to a place where we feel good \nabout demand, then, yeah, we'll take some price.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nPeter Saleh  \nAnalyst, BTIG LLC  Q \nThank you ve ry much.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \n \nOperator : Thank you. Next question is coming from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nJohn Ivankoe  \nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC  Q \nHi. I want to go a couple of different directions. First, Raj, in you prepared remarks, you did talk about seeing \nsome demand destruction at retail. I wondered if you're actually seeing that, if it's recent? Some of the data that \nI've seen, I thought it was recent, was actually showing quite high demand at the retail level. So, I just \u2013 hopefully , \nyour facts being better than mine, just to kind of correct me what we're seeing in retail, and if we are seeing any \nmaterial signs, many slowdown in retail, because that could certainly help us on the restaurant side from a supply \nperspective.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRajesh V ennam  \nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah, John. So, you're right in the fact that if you go back a few months, it's been pretty robust. But if you look at \nthe last month of data, you're starting to see that de cline. [ph] Actual data, the volume (00:53:35) \u2013 the data we \nhave shows that the volume actually declined in the low -single digits year -over-year at retail. That wasn't the case \nfor prior, call it, four, five months or so. So, there was \u2013 yeah, there was s ome resiliency in that but it's starting to \u2013 \nat least, we saw one month of data where it slipped into low -single digit decline year -over-year.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nJohn Ivankoe  \nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC  Q \nOkay. And that's maybe just classic growing season being over  and people are just shifting \u2013 kind of shifting to \nother things. That's helpful. So...  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRajesh Vennam  \nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nNo. No, John, it's year -over-year. Sorry, I just want to clarify. We look a t year -over-year, so its seasonality is \ncaptured in the year -over-year.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nJohn Ivankoe  \nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC  Q \nYes, yeah. But it's \u2013 we're speaking the same language, I just said that awkwardly. So, it was interesting hearing \nthings like reduce d portion, prices of some \u2013 reduced prices and some portions of some core menu items, things \nlike Hawaiian steak. I'm not going to name the brand that it reminds me of 20 years ago but \u2013 and this wasn't a \nDarden concept, but I've seen this done actually qu ite unsuccessfully over time. In other words, when consumers \nkind of expect to see a certain amount of food on the plate, especially at dinner, they \u2013 it's not something that \nyou're necessarily happy with, even if they are paying lower prices.  \n Darden Restaurants, Inc.  (DRI) \nQ1 2026 Earnings Call  Corrected Transcript  \n18-Sep-2025   \n \n1-877-FACTSET   www.callstreet.com   20 \nCopyright \u00a9 2001 -2025  FactSet  CallStreet, LLC  \n \nSo, Rick, I 'm sure you know exactly what I'm talking about. But was there anything to learn about, previous history \nlessons in casual dining? Specifically, I think this is probably tried around 2007, 2008 where smaller portions at \nsmaller prices were tried but weren' t successful. And things like Hawaiian steak way back when, [ph] once you \ntried (00:55:19) that, a few people liked, but really a lot of people different. Where are we on that stage gate \nprocess today in 2025, maybe versus some of the lack of success the o verall industry had 20 years ago?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nHey, John, I'll start with the Hawaiian steak. It's not a smaller portion size, it's a Cheddar's, it's a great portion for \nHawaiian steak. And by the way, LongHorn ran Hawaiian steak and did really well with it a few years back. So, \nmaybe there's different tastes now than there were back then.  \n \nAnd in regards to portion size, I think if you go back 20 or 30 years ago, overall portions were maybe a little bit \nsmaller in the dining \u2013 in the dinner menu already. And so, if somebody brought even smaller portion, it went a \nlittle bit too far. And then, but the way we're thinking about it is there is a consumer group out there that b elieves \nin abundance, but abundance is different for everybody. And by bringing some smaller portion sizes to the dinner \nmenu at Olive Garden, there's still abundant portion sizes, but it also adds price breadth to the menu.  \n \nSo, consumers can choose. We'r e not changing our entire menu to make it a smaller portion, we are putting items \non there that are smaller with a compelling price point. And at Olive Garden, you still get the unlimited soup or \nsalad and you get all the breadsticks you want. So, it's sti ll a great \u2013 it's still abundant.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nJohn Ivankoe  \nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC  Q \nAnd maybe our consumers finally evolved that you don't need to have uneaten food on the plate to feel that \nyou've gotten good value. You can just eat just the right amount  of portion and be happy with it. So, that that \nwould certainly be a change versus the old America, but that'd obviously would be a good direction to go. Okay. \nThank you.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \n \nOperator : Thank you. Next question is coming from Lauren Silberman from Deutsche Bank.

Q \nHey, thanks. So, I just want to go back to the top line. A lot of questions, obviously, what's going on in the \nrestaurant industry broadly. You talked about strong A ugust. Can you just help unpack sort of what you saw in \nterms of cadence of comps during the quarter, any more color on September from that? And then, any differences \nin performance that you're seeing across regions?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRajesh Vennam  \nSenior Vice President &  Chief Financial Officer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah, Lauren, I think from a cadence of comps, we \u2013 actually, the gap to the industry was the biggest for us in \nAugust. In fact, when we look at our own internal comps, we were actually \u2013 July was our w eakest. And so, for us, \nJune was pretty strong, July was still strong, all positive. But just, if you look at the weak month -to-month, July \nwas weaker than June and August. And actually, like I said, August had the biggest gap to the industry.  \n Darden Restaurants, Inc.

It's actually, what we're seeing is fairly similar to \nwhat we're seeing \u2013 what you kind of see in Black Box with certain region \u2013 certain markets still not performing as \nwell, such as Texas. And Florida  is starting to pick back up so it feels like Florida is in the \u2013 is getting better. And \nthen, depending on the brand, California had some decent strength. So, that's all I can share regionally. There's \nnot a lot of other stuff to get into there.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nLauren Silberman  \nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.  Q \nOkay. And then, just to follow -up on the commodity side, what are you expecting in terms of cadence to get to the \n3% to 4% for the year? I understand like there's a commodity price dynamic, but do you expect like 2Q to peak in \nterms of actual commodity inflation?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRajesh Vennam  \nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nAt this point, yes. We think Q2 will probably the peak. But Q3, Q4, probably not that much lower. Bu t I mean, by \nthe time we get to Q4, we expect it to be a little bit better than where we would be, but Q1 would be the lowest \nthat we just had, right, and it was 1.5%. I think pretty much every quarter going forward is \u2013 we're expecting to be \nnorth of 3%. And that's how you get to the 3% to 4% guide. But Q2 is probably the peak, yeah.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nLauren Silberman  \nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.  Q \nOkay. All right.

Next question is coming from Danilo Gargiulo from Bernstein. Your line is now live.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nDanilo Gargiulo  \nAnalyst, Bernstein Institutional Services LLC  Q \nGreat. Thank you. Maybe a year ago or so, you started talking about the relevance and importance of improving \nthe speed of service, and maybe arguably with the increa sed focus on affordability or right person for the right \nprice, there could be even more of an overlap between consumers who might be choosing casual dining over a \nfast food. And so, I'm wondering if you have any early signs or any KPIs that are showing so me momentum that \nyou're picking up in the improvement in speed of service so far?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah, Danilo. Across our brands, we're seeing some brands with some improvement,  and the other brands that \nhaven't really made a whole lot. And so, we had a refocus on that this year at our General Manager Conference, \nand we would expect to see greater improvement in speed of service in the upcoming years. Recall, when I \nmentioned tha t, I said this is going to take a while. And it is taking a while but the managers are really getting on \nboard with it over the last year. And the reinforcement at our conference gives me great confidence that we're \ngoing to get better.  \n \nAs it regard \u2013 in regards to, do we have any data to say that we're taking share from other categories? The only \nthing I can say is all of our consumer groups and all of our income groups were positive year -over-year in casual \ndining, which is probably the best chance to ta ke share from other categories, and those other categories have \nhad a little bit more traffic declines. So, maybe we're taking share or maybe they're just losing some share.  Darden Restaurants, Inc.

And then, it sounds from Raj's response that there's not a lot of regional differences, maybe with the \nexception of Texas, and maybe pockets in California. So, if you're stepping back and analyzing the delta between \nthe top performing stores within the same br and and the bottom performing stores within the same band, what is \nthe one characteristic that is driving the increased performance, and how can you make that more standardized \nacross the rest of the group?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Off icer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nI will say, this is a tried and true thing in restaurants, the thing that drives the most performance within a brand is \nthe quality and consistency of the managers in that restaurant and the team. And so, as tur nover gets better, if \nyou've got a great general manager and a great team of managers that are running things to our standards, you \nhave better performance. And so, that's the \u2013 that's going to be restaurants for the rest of our lives. You can have \nrestaur ants that are in a market that's doing great, but the restaurant's not doing great. It all comes down to \nleadership.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nDanilo Gargiulo  \nAnalyst, Bernstein Institutional Services LLC  Q \nThank you.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \n \nOperator : Thank you.

Thanks, guys. I just wanted to ask if anything to note \u2013 else to note on sort of behaviors at Olive Garden, \nLongHorn or broadly across the portfolio a s it relates to performance across daypart or even kind of within the \nmenu, sides, desserts, alcohol, anything to call out there?

A \nYeah. Look, I think we  are seeing, I mentioned a little bit about alcohol, there is less. We're seeing some lower \npreference on alcohol across most of our brands. There is \u2013 some brands at LongHorn, for example, have grown \nlunch more than their dinner, but all dayparts are grow ing there. And then, in Fine Dining, I think we're seeing a \nlittle bit more drop off in the business travel that's leading to some weekday weakness, but those are some of the \ndynamics from a consumer perspective that I can share.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nDennis Geiger  \nAnalyst, U BS Securities LLC  Q \nGreat.

Vaccaro  \nAnalyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.  Q \nThank you. J ust two quick ones, if I could. First, on the housekeeping side. Raj, could you break out the Olive \nGarden comps between traffic and check? And as we think about check at Olive Garden, I think it's been \nexceeding pricing for the last several quarters. Is i t still reasonable to expect check to exceed price as you think \nabout the next few quarters?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRajesh Vennam  \nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah. Brian, let me start with the breakdown. Olive Garden, same -restaurant sales was 5.9%. The traffic, as we \nmeasure, was 2.8%, but then they also had catering of 80 basis points, so I would categorize that as 3.6% traffic \ngrowth. And then, when you think about the check, the pricing was 1.9%, and Uber fees, basi cally the delivery \nservice fee net of the discounts, was about 40 basis points.  \n \nSo, yeah, as we go into the future, do we expect check to be a little bit higher than pricing? Yes, but it will be \nbecause of the delivery fee and service fee. That's really t he driver, yeah.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nBrian M. Vaccaro  \nAnalyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.  Q \nOkay. Thank you. And then, just as a follow -up. Obviously, talking about investing in the guest experience, as \nyou've been doing for a while, but thinking about fiscal 2026 sp ecifically as well. When you look at labor in the first \nquarter, it looks like labor per operating week as we look at it was up 4.5%, maybe closer to 5%. You talked about \nthe higher incentive comp, and obviously you have higher traffic, which takes more la bor to service. But I'm \ncurious to what degree that also reflects some reinvestments that you're making in the guest experience, and \nmaybe you could provide a few examples of the specifics on those reinvestments? Thank you.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRajesh Vennam  \nSenior Vice Pres ident & Chief Financial Officer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.

So, if you look at \u2013 \nyou mentioned 4.5% increase on dollars. But if you take the 3.1%, that is part  of it. Then, it was up about 1 point \nor so, but our traffic was up closer to 3% once you take into consideration the catering for the \u2013 at the Darden \nlevel. So, that means we're actually getting some leverage on that traffic.  \n \nAnd so, that's really what's  happening and that's why I mentioned in the script that we were \u2013 we had productivity \nimprove actually year -over-year. We continue to look at ways to invest in labor. I don't think we need to get into \nspecifics, but some of the things that Rick mentioned about speed, those are places where we're looking at how \ndo we help ensure that, but that doesn't translate necessarily into a labor deleverage, because you actually get \nmore throughput when we make those investments.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nBrian M.

Just had a few follow -up questions. Going back to the delivery \nsegment, have you discussed what percentage of sales mix was incremental? I think that's been a little bit of a \nmoving target, especially given the promotions. Maybe you could update us on what you expect incrementally out \nof delivery for both Olive Garden and Cheddar's?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah. Jim, I'll speak specifically outside of the promotion,  it's about 50% incremental. During the promotion, when \nyou get free delivery, some of the people that would have gotten normal to go probably shifted into delivery. But \noutside of that, it's about 50% both at Cheddar's and Olive Garden.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nJim Sanderson  \nAnalyst, Northcoast Research Partners LLC  Q \nOkay. So, relatively stable with what it has been, let's say?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYes. \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nJim Sanderson  \nAnalyst, Northcoast Research Partners LLC  Q \nAnd then, just a follow -up question on Olive Garden. When we were talking about the breakdown of same -store \nsales, I didn't really detect any negative mix. And I was wondering, does that mean that the smaller portions and \nthe promotions are n't having any meaningful impact on check? Is that the right way to look at that?  Darden Restaurants, Inc.

A \nWell, they have \u2013 that specifically has a negative impact, but it was offset by oth er mix. So, we are seeing we had \n\u2013 I think we mentioned on the call, we had a \u2013 we had the Calabrian steak and shrimp that had a higher price, but \nwe actually had [ph] it saw a (01:09:36) pretty strong preference there that helped. So, it was mostly entr\u00e9e  mix \nitself tended towards higher value, sometimes maybe higher priced items.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nJim Sanderson  \nAnalyst, Northcoast Research Partners LLC  Q \nThat's it.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for participating on today's call. Joining me are R ick \nCardenas, Darden's President and CEO; and Raj Vennam, CFO.  \n \nAs a reminder, comments made during this call will include forward -looking statements as defined in the Private \nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause \nthe actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. Those risks are described in the \ncompany's press release, which was distributed this morning and in its filings with the Securities and Exchan ge \nCommission.  \n \nWe are simultaneously broadcasting a presentation during this call, which is posted in the Investor Relations \nsection of our website at darden.com.  \n \nToday's discussion and presentation include certain non -GAAP measurements, and reconciliati ons of these \nmeasurements are included in the presentation. Looking ahead, we plan to release fiscal 2026 first quarter \nearnings on Thursday, September 18 before the market opens, followed by a conference call.  \n \nDuring today's call, all reference to the in dustry results refer to Black Box Intelligence casual dining benchmark \nexcluding Darden. During the fiscal fourth quarter, average same -restaurant sales for the industry grew 3.0%, and \naverage same -restaurant guest counts grew 0.9%.  \n \nThis morning, Rick will share some brief remarks on the quarter. Raj will provide details on our fourth quarter and \nfull year financial results as well as share our fiscal 2026 financial outlook. Then, Rick will close with some final \ncomments.  \n \nNow, I will turn the call over  to Rick.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  \nThank you, Courtney, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong quarter with same -restaurant sales and \nearnings growth that exceeded our expectations. I' m proud of the great work by our restaurant teams throughout \nthe quarter, particularly on Mother's Day, as several brands achieved sales records for that day.  \n Darden Restaurants, Inc.  (DRI) \nQ4 2025 Earnings Call  Corrected Transcript  \n20-Jun-2025   \n \n1-877-FACTSET   www.callstreet.com   4 \nCopyright \u00a9 2001 -2025  FactSet  CallStreet, LLC  \n \nThe return of Olive Garden's Buy One, Take One offer for the first time in five years, combined with the continued \nstrength of off -premise drove their impressive sales during the quarter. Olive Garden's marketing strategy to \nmeaningfully communicate strong value, create urgency, and introduce food news continue to resonate as guests \nare motivated by news and compelling price points.  \n \nBuy One, Take One, with a starting price point of $14.99 allowed guests to choose one entr\u00e9e for their dining \nexperience and then take a second one home. The take home selections leveraged Olive Garden's existing $6 \ntake home platform, minimizing operational complexity. During Buy One, Take One, Olive Garden's same -\nrestaurant sales gap versus the industry increased to 450 basis points.  \n \nWith delivery available nationwide the entire quarter, Olive Garden continued to see or der volume grow week -to-\nweek, while retaining higher than average sales per transaction versus curbside pickup orders. This, combined \nwith continued growth in catering and curbside ToGo drove overall takeout sales to grow nearly 20% over last \nyear.  \n \nAt the  end of the quarter, Olive Garden launched a campaign to promote delivery across multiple channels, \nincluding television advertising, with a compelling and memorable offer, 1 million free deliveries, partially funded \nby Uber. We continue to see strong incr ementality with average weekly deliveries per restaurant nearly doubling \nduring the last two weeks of the quarter.  \n \nThe Olive Garden team continued to execute at a high level, which led to an all -time high guest satisfaction score \nfor the quarter. I am extremely proud of how Dan Kiernan and his team managed the business throughout the \nyear, and the strong momentum they have generated heading into the new fiscal year.  \n \nAt LongHorn Steakhouse, their ongoing commitment to quality, simplicity and culture con tinues to drive their \nmomentum. Their entire team remains obsessed with serving the highest quality steaks in casual dining. This \nincludes having industry -leading specifications and ensuring they perfectly season and grill every steak they \nserve.  \n \nTo suppo rt this, during the quarter, Olive Garden validated each one of their grill master's expertise with the \nEighth Annual Steak Master Series, their internal grilling competition and training program. Congratulations to Tim \nCrain from the LongHorn Steakhouse i n Independence, Missouri, who claimed the championship trophy. This \nfocus on ongoing training continues to pay off, as LongHorn ended the year with an all -time high steaks grilled \ncorrectly score, as well as a new all -time high guest satisfaction score for  the quarter.  \n \nLaura Williamson and her team have done a great job of building on the business momentum at LongHorn. For \nthe fiscal year, their same -restaurant sales increased 5.1%, and they reached a major milestone by surpassing $3 \nbillion in total sales . These results reflect the strength of their focused strategy.  \n \nLast quarter, we announced Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen had begun piloting Uber Direct. It was a successful pilot \nand, as of last week, delivery is now available in all but eight Cheddar's resta urants. Paid media and email \nsupport began earlier this week, partially funded by Uber. The Cheddar's marketing team also continues to build \non its use of connected television, debuting the first 32nd spot in Cheddar's history during the quarter. The spot \nwas developed at no cost to Darden, thanks to the scale of our CTV media spend across our portfolio.  \n \nIn addition to Olive Garden and LongHorn, Cheddar's also received an all -time high guest satisfaction score for \nthe quarter, as did Ruth's Chris Steak Hou se and Eddie V's. We know that engaged, well -trained team members \nhelp drive operational success, and two of our brands were recognized for their people practices during the Darden Restaurants, Inc.  (DRI) \nQ4 2025 Earnings Call  Corrected Transcript  \n20-Jun-2025   \n \n1-877-FACTSET   www.callstreet.com   5 \nCopyright \u00a9 2001 -2025  FactSet  CallStreet, LLC  \n \nquarter. LongHorn and The Capital Grille received the Employer of Choice awards fr om Black Box Intelligence for \nCasual Dining and Fine Dining, respectively. The award recognizes exemplary performance in managing turnover \nrates, fostering an inclusive workplace culture and implementing best -in-class people practices.  \n \nOverall, I am pleas ed with our results. Our adherence to our winning strategy anchored in our four competitive \nadvantages and being brilliant with the basics led to a successful year. Our strategy remains the right one for the \ncompany, and we will continue to execute it to d rive growth and long -term shareholder value.  \n \nNow, I will turn it over to Raj.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRajesh Vennam  \nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  \nThank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. As Rick said, fiscal 2025 was another strong year, driven by \ndisciplined execution of our strategy. In the fourth quarter, same -restaurant sales continued the sequential \nimprovement from prior quarters, with our casual brands gaining significant market share. This resulted in sales \nand earning s exceeding our expectations for the quarter. Furthermore, we finished the year with same -restaurant \nsales at the top of our initial guidance range and earnings in the upper half of the range, despite the slower than \nexpected start to the year.  \n \nNow, looki ng at the fourth quarter, we generated $3.3 billion of total sales, 10.6% higher than prior year. This was \ndriven by same -restaurant sales growth of 4.6% with positive traffic growth, the acquisition of 103 Chuy's \nrestaurants, and the addition of 25 net ne w restaurants, which includes the permanent closure of 22 \nunderperforming restaurants.  \n \nSame -restaurant sales exceeded the industry benchmark for the quarter and were in the top decile of the \nindustry. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuin g operations increased 12.5% to $2.98. We \ngenerated $582 million of adjusted EBITDA and returned $215 million to shareholders through $164 million in \ndividends and $51 million of share repurchases.  \n \nTurning to the fourth quarter P&L compared to last year, food and beverage expenses were 60 basis points lower \nas commodities inflation was better than expected at approximately 1.5%. Restaurant labor was 10 basis points \nlower, as productivity gains more than offset higher performance -based compensation, and pri cing below total \nlabor inflation of approximately 3.5%. Restaurant expenses were 20 basis points higher, driven by brand mix with \nthe addition of Chuy's and the impact of first party delivery at Olive Garden, partially offset by sales leverage.  \n \nMarketing expenses were flat at 1.3% of sales, consistent with our expectations. This all resulted in restaurant -\nlevel EBITDA for the quarter improving 50 basis points to 21.6%. Pre -opening costs were 10 basis points higher \nas we accelerated our new restaurant pipel ine, opening 19 restaurants during the quarter. Adjusted G&A \nexpenses were 30 basis points higher due to higher incentive compensation accrual compared to the fourth \nquarter last year and unfavorable mark -to-market expenses on our deferred compensation. Be cause of the way \nwe hedge mark -to-market expense, this is largely offset in the tax line.  \n \nInterest expense increased 20 basis points, due to the financing expenses related to the Chuy's acquisition. And \nour adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 12.2%, with tax expenses down 20 basis points because of the \nmark -to-market hedge impact I referenced earlier. In total, our adjusted earnings from continuing operations were \n$352 million, which was 10.7% of sales.  \n Darden Restaurants, Inc.  (DRI) \nQ4 2025 Earnings Call  Corrected Transcript  \n20-Jun-2025   \n \n1-877-FACTSET   www.callstreet.com   6 \nCopyright \u00a9 2001 -2025  FactSet  CallStreet, LLC  \n \nIn the fourth quarter, all of our segmen ts grew total sales, with three of the four segments growing same -\nrestaurant sales and segment profit margin. Olive Garden increased total sales for the quarter by 8.1%, with \nstrong same -restaurant sales growth of 6.9% and the addition of 15 net new restau rants. Olive Garden's same -\nrestaurant sales outperformed the industry benchmark by 390 basis points for the quarter.  \n \nUber Direct delivery fees positively benefited check mix by about 40 basis points in the quarter. These fees were \npassed on to Uber, with the revenue fully offset in restaurant expenses. Olive Garden continues to have industry -\nleading segment profit margin, delivering 23.8% for the quarter, which is 100 basis points higher than last year.  \n \nAt LongHorn, total sales increased 9.3%, driven by s ame-restaurant sales growth of 6.7%, and the addition of 16 \nnet new restaurants. LongHorn continues to increase market share, with strong and sustained sales growth \nexceeding the industry same -restaurant sales benchmark by 370 basis points this quarter, an d 850 basis points \non a two -year basis. Segment profit margin for the quarter was 20.1%, 80 basis points above last year.  \n \nTotal sales for Fine Dining segment increased 2.3%, driven by the addition of six net new restaurants, which \nincludes the permanent c losure of two underperforming restaurants. Same -restaurant sales were negative for the \nquarter, resulting in segment profit margin lower than last year. While the Fine Dining category as a whole \ncontinues to be challenged, we are seeing sequential improvem ent in guest traffic from households earning \n$150,000 and above.  \n \nTotal sales for the Other Business segment increased 22.4%, with the acquisition of Chuy's and positive same -\nrestaurant sales at Yard House and Cheddar's. This positive growth was partially offset by the permanent closure \nof 20 restaurants during the quarter, including 15 Bahama Breeze restaurants.  \n \nPositive sales momentum and continued productivity improvements at Yard House and Cheddar's contributed to \na 17.5% segment profit margin for the Other Business segment, 10 basis points higher than last year. The \nintegration of Chuy's is progressing as planned, with synergies on track and a neutral impact to EPS for fiscal \n2025, which is in line with our expectations.  \n \nAs we look at our annual resul ts for fiscal 2025, we had same -restaurant sales growth of 2%, outperforming the \nindustry by 170 basis points. Total sales increased 6%, surpassing $12 billion for the first time in our history. \nAdjusted diluted net earnings per share from continuing opera tions increased 7.5% to $9.55. We delivered $2 \nbillion in adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, driven by strong sales growth, and we returned $1.1 billion \nto shareholders, with $659 million in dividends and $418 million in share repurchases.  \n \nLookin g at our fiscal 2025 full year P&L, restaurant -level EBITDA grew 40 basis points, driven by disciplined cost \nmanagement and pricing leverage. This favorability was partially offset by the increased depreciation and \namortization expense, resulting in operat ing income margin that was 10 basis points higher than last year. \nFinancing expenses related to Chuy's acquisition increased adjusted interest expense 20 basis points from last \nyear. This all resulted in adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 9.4% , which was 10 basis points below \nlast year.  \n \nAs I mentioned earlier, we permanently closed 15 underperforming Bahama Breeze restaurants, as well as a few \nrestaurants at other brands. These closures will result in a headwind to our fiscal 2026 total sales growth, but are \nexpected to be slightly positive to earnings. Fiscal 2026 is a 53 -week year, and we anticipate a positive impact \nfrom the extra week on diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of approximately $0.20.  \n Darden Restaurants, Inc.  (DRI) \nQ4 2025 Earnings Call  Corrected Transcript  \n20-Jun-2025   \n \n1-877-FACTSET   www.callstreet.com   7 \nCopyright \u00a9 2001 -2025  FactSet  CallStreet, LLC  \n \nNow, turning to our f inancial outlook for fiscal 2026. We expect total sales growth of 7% to 8%, including \napproximately 2% from the additional week; same -restaurant sales growth of 2% to 3.5%; and opening 60 to 65 \nnew restaurants; capital spending between $700 million and $75 0 million; total inflation of 2.5% to 3%, with \ncommodities inflation of approximately 2.5% and total labor inflation of approximately 3.5%; EBITDA of $2.16 \nbillion to $2.19 billion; an annual effective tax rate of approximately 13%; and approximately $117 million (sic) \n[117 million] (00:16:17) diluted average shares outstanding for the year; all resulting in diluted net earnings per \nshare between $10.50 and $10.70.  \n \nThis morning, we also announced that our board approved a 7% increase to our regular quarter ly dividend to \n$1.50 per share, implying an annual dividend of $6.  \n \nNow, turning to our long -term financial framework, which outlines the strategic priorities and performance \nexpectations that guide our sustained value creation, we remain committed to deli vering 10% to 15% total \nshareholder return as defined by EPS growth plus dividend yield. However, we're updating the framework to \nreflect a greater emphasis on sales growth with appropriate investments while maintaining or growing margin. As \na result, we a re increasing new restaurant growth to 3% to 4%, same -restaurant sales growth to 1.5% to 3.5%. \nAdditionally, we're updating how we define margin expansion, shifting from EBIT margin to earnings after tax \nmargin to more accurately reflect how we view and ma nage our business.  \n \nThere are three primary drivers of this change. First, due to the way we hedge mark -to-market expense on our \ndeferred compensation, the impact in G&A is largely offset in the tax line. Second, current lease accounting \nguidelines result in an ongoing negative impact to interest and depreciation, with an offsetting benefit in restaurant \nexpense. And third, to account for any interest expense associated with any future acquisitions.  \n \nOur updated framework targets EAT margin growth to be fla t to 20 basis points. This all results in EAT growth \ncontributing 6% to 10% of total shareholder return. Our dividend remains a priority and the target payout ratio \nrange of 50% to 60% remains unchanged. Share repurchase is being updated from a dollar rang e to a \npercentage range of contribution to shareholder return. Return of cash is now targeted to contribute 4% to 5% of \ntotal shareholder return.  \n \nLooking at our performance since 2019 relative to the updated framework, new restaurant growth inclusive of \nacquisitions was within the updated range, having grown 3.1%. Same -restaurant sales of 2.9% is in the top half of \nthe target range, and EAT margin expansion was above the midpoint of the updated range, increasing 13 basis \npoints on an annualized basis, resu lting in an annualized EAT growth of 7.6%, near the middle of the range.  \n \nThe dividend payout ratio of 58% is near the top -end of the range, and share repurchase contribution to \nshareholder return was 1%, culminating in total cash return of 4.1%, despite t he issuance of 9 million shares of \ncommon stock in fiscal 2020. Total shareholder return, as defined by EPS growth plus dividend yield, was 11.6% \nand within our targeted range. Additionally, over our 30 -year history as a publicly -traded company, Darden has  \nachieved an annualized total shareholder return of 10% or greater for any 10 fiscal year period when taking into \naccount Darden's stock appreciation plus dividend yield.  \n \nFinally, our strong operating model generates significant and durable cash flows. Since fiscal 2019, we've grown \nEBITDA by about $800 million and are on track to reach nearly $1 billion in EBITDA growth by the end of fiscal \n2026. Our balance sheet at the end of fiscal 2025 is well -positioned, with adjusted debt to EBITDA of 2.1 times. \nThis is at the low end of our targeted range of 2 to 2.5 times, despite the additional debt related to the acquisition \nof Chuy's and Ruth's Chris over the past two years.  \n Darden Restaurants, Inc.

Strategic planning is one of our competitive advantages, and at the Darden level, it ensures that we \nhave the right portfolio of brands. We align strategies and coordinate operations to maximize our portf olio's value, \nand we capture the available synergies across all our brands. For our brands, our strategic planning process \nallows us to determine the strategic role in a portfolio, identify their distinct advantages and cultivate differentiated \npositioning , develop a deep understanding of their guests and the competitive landscape, and ensure they adhere \nto their strategy so they can compete effectively and grow share.  \n \nDuring the quarter, we completed our five -year planning process. Each of our brands has a clear understanding of \ntheir role in their portfolio, and they have built a five -year strategic plan based on that role, focusing on what they \nneed to do to win today and into 2030. They have already begun to put their plans in action and will execute th em \nto drive shareholder value.  \n \nAdditionally, there were some other key outcomes from that process that I would like to share. As Raj mentioned, \nwe made the decision to close 15 Bahama Breeze locations in May, leaving the 28 highest performing Bahama \nBreez e restaurants in our portfolio. After further review, we have made the difficult decision that these remaining \nlocations and the Bahama Breeze brand are not a strategic priority for us.  \n \nWe also believe that this brand and these restaurants have the potent ial to benefit from a new owner. \nConsequently, we will be considering strategic alternatives for Bahama Breeze, including a potential sale of the \nbrand or converting restaurants to other Darden brands. Excluding any one -time potential impacts which are \nunknown as of today, we do not expect these strategic alternatives, including a potential sale, to have a material \nimpact on our financial results.  \n \nWe also signed a definitive agreement to sell the eight Olive Garden locations in Canada to Recipe Unlimited, the \nlargest full service operator in Canada, and we are on track to close that deal soon. These eight restaurants will \nbecome franchised, and upon close, Darden and Recipe Unlimited will enter into an area development agreement \nto open 30 more Olive Garden s over the next 10 years. Their expertise in the Canadian market will help the Olive \nGarden better operate locally and accelerate the brand's ability to grow throughout the country.  \n \nOur international franchising team, led by Brad Smith, is focused on grow ing our global presence. Today, we have \n154 franchise locations, which includes 63 in the continental United States and 91 outside the continental United \nStates.  \n \nOne of the benefits of the Ruth's Chris acquisition was the scale it added to our franchise b usiness. The increase \nin revenue from adding 74 Ruth's Chris franchise locations has allowed the team to grow faster. We were able to \nadd the resources and systems to help our franchisees better operate our brands that would have taken us longer \nif we had not added the Ruth's Chris restaurants, and the team has been busy signing new area development \nagreements with international partners.  \n \nIn addition to the agreement with Recipe Unlimited, we also have new agreements with partners in India and \nSpain, each of which calls for the development of 40 Olive Garden locations, as well as an agreement with our \nexisting Ruth's Chris franchise partner in Asia for the development of six Capital Grille locations. Brad and his \nteam are doing a great job, and I'm excited about the growth prospects of our international franchising business.  \n Darden Restaurants, Inc.

Dan has worked in the in dustry since he was 16 and began \nhis career at Olive Garden as a Manager in Training. For the last seven years, he has led Olive Garden to new \nheights and has had \u2013 has been a tremendous steward of the brand. As I said earlier, Dan and his team have \ngenera ted strong business momentum. And following the successful completion of their five -year business plan, \nOlive Garden is well -positioned for this leadership transition.  \n \nOne of the benefits of our scale is having a deep bench of talent to fill leadership ro les. I am pleased that we have \nanother proven operator to lead Olive Garden. John Wilkerson, who has led Cheddar's for the past seven years, \nwill be the next President of Olive Garden, and he will work closely with Dan over the next 10 weeks to ensure a \nsmooth transition. John is a 30 -year Darden veteran who has done an excellent job of rebuilding the \nfundamentals at Cheddar's and setting the brand up for growth. John will continue reporting to me.  \n \nJohn's replacement at Cheddar's is Mark Cooper, currently President of Seasons 52 and Bahama Breeze. Laurie \nCasler, who has led operations at Seasons for 52 years \u2013 I am sorry, Seasons 52 for 11 years, sorry, Laurie, I \ndidn't want to age you, has been named President of Seasons 52. Mark and Laurie will report to John Martin, \nGroup President. In addition to Cheddar's and Seasons 52, John Martin will retain responsibility for Yard House, \nThe Capital Grille, and Eddie V's. He will also lead Bahama Breeze as we consider strategic alternatives for the \nbrand.  \n \nAdditiona lly, I am pleased to share that Thomas Hall has been named President of Chuy's. For the past seven \nyears, Thomas served as Executive Vice President of Operations for LongHorn. Thomas will report to Todd \nBurrowes, Group President, who is responsible for Chu y's and Ruth's Chris, as well as Darden's development and \ninternational franchising teams. With these changes, I am confident we have the right leaders in place across all \nour brands to compete effectively and grow share.  \n \nFinally, last month, Darden celeb rated its 30th year as a publicly -traded company. I was delighted to ring the \nopening bell at the New York Stock Exchange with several team members with 30 or more years of service, \nincluding [ph] Livalle Rutledge (00:26:48), our longest tenured team membe r at 52 years.  \n \nThat moment was a great reminder of an enduring quote from Bill Darden. He said, the greatest edge we have on \nour competitors is the quality of our employees reflected each day in the job they do. Our people drive our \nsuccess, and I want to  congratulate our teams on a strong quarter and a successful year. On behalf of our \nleadership team and the board of directors, thank you for your continued dedication and commitment to \nnourishing and delighting our guests and each other.  \n \nNow, we'll take your questions.  \n  Darden Restaurants, Inc.

We'll now be conducting a question -and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And as a \nreminder, please ask one question and one follow -up, then return to the queue. Our first question is coming from \nEric Gonzalez from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now live.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nEric Gonzalez  \nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.  Q \nHi. Thanks for the question and congrats on a really strong same -store sales results. Well, obviously, you're \nexecuting at a very high level. It's really hard to deny the fact that the industry seem to be in a strong position, \nparticularly some of the larger chains in full service. So, perhaps you can give us your perspective on why casual \ndining is having a bit o f a moment right now. And relatedly, I'm curious on your thoughts on how some of the \nsmaller chains or independents may be faring in this environment? And whether you think the independents are \nstruggling with the same affordability perception issues that you might have in fast food?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah. Eric, thanks for the question, and thanks for the comment on our quarter. As we look across what's been \ngoing on over the last five or six years, as you recall, we've been very prudent in keeping our pricing below \ninflation because we knew that over time, pricing matters if you take it too much.  \n \nAnd what we believe is happening right now in the casual dining space is consumers ar e figuring out that casual \ndining is a great value. And so, they're coming to casual dining more, and we're starting \u2013 we're seeing that \nacross our brands and some of the industry. And so, without commenting on what's happened in other places, we \nthink tha t's a big part of it. Consumers want to go out and spend their hard -earned money and we think we're \ntaking some wallet share from fast food and fast casual.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nEric Gonzalez  \nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.  Q \nMaybe if I could, as a follow up, ask about the unit growth outlook, the 60 to 65 units this year, your long -term \nrange in your algorithm is 3% to 4%. So, I think the 60 to 65 implies 2.7% to 3%. So, I guess I'm curious, when we \nmight see a ramp in unit growth and which brands might be the lar gest contributor?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRajesh Vennam  \nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah, Eric, I'd say from \u2013 when you look at 60 to 65, you're right, it could imply 2.7% to 3%. But as you look at \nactually how we're ramping up g rowth, from where we're starting, we're actually building the pipeline. Our \ndevelopment team has done a great job. We expect to be in the 3 -plus range over the next five years, and we are \nactually \u2013 we have a pretty strong pipeline.  \n \nAs you know, these thi ngs take time to build up. But I think we have new practices and processes in place. And \nfrom a brand mix, as we've said, initially, as you look at next year, I'd say between Olive Garden and LongHorn, \nwe're going to probably have 40 to 45 openings, and th en Yard House might be in the mid -single digits, and then \nyou have all the other brands contributing probably another 15 or so.  \n Darden Restaurants, Inc.

But we do think \nthere is huge op portunity for still LongHorn to be in the 25 to 30 openings a year and then Olive Garden to be in \nthe 20 -ish range for the foreseeable future. But then we're also \u2013 as I said, the other brands will start to contribute \neven more as we move into the next few  years.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \n \nOperator : Thanks. The next question is coming from Chris O'Cull from Stifel. Your line is now live.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nChris O'Cull  \nAnalyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.  Q \nYeah. Thanks. Raj, my question was on the updated long term framework. Does the new margin expansion target \nreflect a different view on the long term restaurant margin opportunity, or even the rate of reinvestment you expect \nto make in the business?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRajesh Vennam  \nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah, Chris. It does a little bit, right? What we're trying to figure out is, one, let me just start with the \u2013 just by \nchanging the definition, we're getting a more holistic view because there's a lot of interaction between the G&A \nand D&A and then tax  and interest. So, that's why we wanted to get the bottom line number. So, that's one.  \n \nBut two, does it imply restaurant -level EBITDA maybe not growing at the rate we've targeted in the past? Yes, \nbecause we're saying that we're going to make investments with a greater emphasis on sales growth. And if sales \ngrowth drives even more margin, that's good. But we are going to try to find ways to reinvest to get for the long \nterm.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nChris O'Cull  \nAnalyst, Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.  Q \nOkay. Thank you, guys.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \n \nOperator : Thanks. The next question is coming from David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nDavid Palmer  \nAnalyst, Evercore ISI  Q \nThank you. Regarding Uber Direct at Olive Garden, curious about what you can share about mix and same -store \nsales contribution in fiscal 4Q and what you're contemplating for mix and same -store sales contribution from it in \nfiscal 2026. And also, is there anything different about the incremental margin from that from the base business?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRajesh Vennam  \nSenior Vice P resident & Chief Financial Officer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah, David. So, I think we said on \u2013 for Q4, the mix impact from just the fees was about 40 basis points. Uber \nDirect was about 3.5% of total sales at Olive Garden. So \u2013 and I think we talked  about in the past what the total \ncontribution would be to incremental sales and we've said it's 40% to 50%. So, if you kind of go with that and take \nin the impact of the fees, it's roughly about 2% incremental sales impact for the quarter.  \n \nWe are not rea dy to talk about the future in terms of what the impact would be for next year. But when we did \nadvertise, the exit rate was about 5% of total sales. That included the free delivery offer. And from a margin \nperspective, we do not expect this to have a mean ingful impact of negative on margin \u2013 any negative impact or Darden Restaurants, Inc.  (DRI) \nQ4 2025 Earnings Call  Corrected Transcript  \n20-Jun-2025   \n \n1-877-FACTSET   www.callstreet.com   12 \nCopyright \u00a9 2001 -2025  FactSet  CallStreet, LLC  \n \npositive impact on margin, because if you look at how we structure the deal, a lot of the fees are just passed on to \nUber, but there isn't any margin difference on the base and the minimal \u2013 the geography impact is pretty minimal.  \n \nYou're talking about maybe 10 basis points at best, but then there's also positive. People are buying more through \nthat. That helps offset. And you saw that in the fourth quarter. Olive Garden has a pretty strong positive mix. And I \nthink as we signaled a few times, if Uber Direct contributes even more than we expect going into this year, we're \ngoing to reinvest some of that into the business to drive long -term growth.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nDavid Palmer  \nAnalyst, Evercore ISI  Q \nThank you for that. And with regard to Uber Direct and other brands, I would assume that this is going as you \nwould have expected for Olive Garden. Are there other [ph] stalls (00:34:19) that you think are particular to \nLongHorn and the other brands that [ph] yo u'll (00:34:24) want to figure out before you do Uber Direct at those \nbrands that you think might be an additional hurdle, or are you kind of seeing probably what you need to see from \nthis as a lever that could apply to your other brands? And thank you.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah, David. As we launched it in Cheddar's and got pretty similar answers to Olive Garden, we were able to \nramp it up faster and get it into most of the restaurant s faster. The other brands, we'll continue to look at. We have \nsome thoughts on what brand might go next, but we want to make sure that every brand that adds delivery has a \ngreat experience for their ToGo.  \n \nAnd so, we mentioned that there were eight Chedda r's restaurants that didn't \u2013 that aren't live. That's because \nthey didn't earn the right to have delivery. That doesn't mean that our other brands don't have a great experience, \nbut there are \u2013 other brands might have a little less on the curbside space a nd those kinds of things. So, they \nmight not even be able to have curbside pickup.  \n \nAnd as you recall, we don't want the Uber drivers to come into our restaurant. We want that to be just like another \ncurbside experience. So, we're looking through our portfolio to see what we can do on some of the brands that \nmight not have as much curbside to see if we want to add.  \n \nBut the last thing I'll say on this is we are not pushing Uber Direct onto any brand. Every brand has their President \nand their leaders an d they choose if they want to do it. We can veto if they get it. And there's some brands that we \nwould probably veto, but I don't think those brands are thinking about doing it. So, without getting into which we're \nin is next, we do have another brand that  we think we're going to work on, but it'll probably not start until sometime \nright at the beginning of the next calendar year.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \n \nOperator : Thanks. The next question today is coming from Andrew Charles from TD Cowen. Your line is now \nlive. \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nAndrew M. Cha rles \nAnalyst, TD Cowen  Q \nGreat. Thank you. Rick, it's a good segue to my next question. I'm curious, are you prioritizing expanding rolling \nout Uber Direct across the remaining brands that make sense, recognizing it's not going to be all of them, or is \nthere aptitude to see how Olive Garden would perform on the Uber marketplace?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....

A \nRight now, our priority is to continue to see how Olive Garden and Cheddar's perform in Uber Direct. Marketplace \nis something that has challenges for us and we've said what those challenges are. And that's why we developed \nthis Uber Direct offer with Uber, which was the perfect thing for us and a really great thing for Uber. So, we'll \ncontinue to see how this goes before we determine whether we want to even be on the marketplace at all.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nAndrew M. Charles  \nAnalyst, TD Cowen  Q \nOkay. That's helpful. And then, Raj, just a follow up question. With the outlook for 2026 inflation of 2.5% to 3%, \ncan you segue how that's going to look between food and labor?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRajesh Vennam  \nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYes, Andrew. So, the food is \u2013 we're expecting food to be about 2.5% and labor to be about 3.5%.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \n \nOperator : Thanks. Your next question is coming from Lauren Silberman from Credit Suisse (sic) Deutsche Bank \n(00:37:33). Your line is now live.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nLauren Silberman  \nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.  Q \nThank you very much and congrats on the quarter. I wanted to follow up on fiscal 2026 guidance for the EPS. If \nyour top line comes in stronger than expected, are you thinking about flowing through to earnings versus \nreinvesting back in the business and I guess that kind of applies a bit to the long term?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRajesh Vennam  \nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah. Lauren, I think if you look at our framework, we said we're going to try to get EAT margin to be flat to \npositive. So, we're not going to do it at the cost of  giving up margin. But we're going to \u2013 we're okay if the \nincremental sales just flow through at the current restaurant -level margins and then reinvest the rest. So, there's \nways to do that and that's kind of how we're thinking about it.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nLauren Silberman  \nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.  Q \nOkay. Thanks. And then on the 2% to 3.5% comp growth, obviously, a very strong momentum in the business. \nCan you just talk about how you're thinking about the cadence of comp as we move through the year?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRajesh  Vennam  \nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nWell, maybe I'll just start by saying if you look at \u2013 fourth quarter was obviously pretty strong for us. And some of \nthe momentum from that has carried on into June, firs t few weeks of June. But as we look at the 12 -month out, \nthere's obviously \u2013 there's a lot of macro uncertainty. And so, we thought looking at 12 months, just it's prudent to \nkind of go with this range where we reflect the uncertainty because we are going to start [ph] ramping (00:39:02) \non some of these growth as we get into the back half of the year. And so, that's incorporated into guidance. I don't Darden Restaurants, Inc.  (DRI) \nQ4 2025 Earnings Call  Corrected Transcript  \n20-Jun-2025   \n \n1-877-FACTSET   www.callstreet.com   14 \nCopyright \u00a9 2001 -2025  FactSet  CallStreet, LLC  \n \nwant to get too much into the cadence, but I think it's fair to assume that we'll start stronger. And from  a year -\nover-year perspective, should be stronger in the first half than the back half.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \n \nOperator : Thanks.

Your line is now \nlive. \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nBrian Harbour  \nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \nYes. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Raj, what \u2013 roughly what pricing do you expect to run in the coming year? And \nI guess just how about, like, longer -term? I mean, it sort of continuing to restrain that sort of key to all the brands \nas we think about the long term plan?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRajesh Vennam  \nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah, Brian. For fiscal 2026, I would expect us to be in that mid -2s for pricing. I think first quarter is going to be \nclose to 2% and then we'll probably get into the mid to high -2s as we get through the year. Obviously, it depends \non how inflation comes in. But our bias \u2013 but it will still likely be below total inflation.  \n \nAnd our bias is, as Rick just mentioned earlier, we've been very discipline d with respect to pricing. And that is not \ngoing to change anytime soon. That's the philosophy. We try to price as little as possible and still get the returns \nwe could get. And it's worked well for us. And we always play the long game and we'll continue t o do that.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nBrian Harbour  \nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \nOkay. And your comment about sort of reserving the right to reinvest, I mean, it sounds like you're just being more \ntop line focused, right, in the current algo. So, I mean, to some extent, wh at form would that take? Would it be \nmore on the food side or how would that actually show itself in the brands?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah, Brian. Yeah, you got it right. We are going  to focus a little bit more on top line growth and on just grabbing \nmargin. And that will \u2013 that can take place in many ways. Every brand has a different way to do that. Olive Garden \nis testing some things right now which would bring their mix down a littl e bit, to be more \u2013 have some more \naffordability. And because of the strength of Uber Direct, they're able to do that.  \n \nOther brands might make some investments in labor to speed up the process. But it's only as we continue to grow \nsales will we make some of these investments. We think these are the right long term investments to be able to \nset the company up for the next 30 \u2013 for the next five years. And the investments that we're making, especially on \nthe menu, whether it's in mix or in affordability, wil l benefit both dine in and off -premise.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \n \nOperator : Thanks.

I guess just wanted to ask about Fine Dining . You mentioned that the category has been pressured, \nbut I think, unlike some of your other larger casual dining, you might be lagging some peers. I guess the question \nis maybe broader about, like, sort of the approach to the portfolio and your decision t o sell some Bahama Breeze \n[indiscernible] (00:42:29), but is there sort of a limit to the span of control that you can have in terms of the \nnumber of brands? Is the acquisition of Ruth's, would that have played any role in Fine Dining, maybe being a \nlittle bit softer just in terms of managerial resources? I'm just trying to understand sort of as you think about the \nportfolio, feels like there's a little bit more movement now than I've seen in the past, and I'm trying to sort of think \nthrough what might be i nfluencing that.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.

We have \u2013 if we look \u2013 if you look back a couple of years ago, we were in a \nposition where we had leaders that are getting close to retirement age. And so, we wanted to set the company up \nfor success over the long -term and we made some changes a year ago. And one of those leaders has retired, so \nwe were ready for it with the changes we're doing this year. So, we're really planful of what we do.  \n \nIn regards to the span of control or the scale \u2013 of the people that we have, now you look at how we'v e structured \nthe company on people. The two largest brands report to me, Olive Garden and LongHorn, and the other brands \nreport to two proven leaders, Todd Burrowes and John Martin. And so, we think we've got it set up correctly. The \nnumber of brands reall y doesn't \u2013 isn't a reason that Fine Dining has gone through the challenges they've gone \nthrough.  \n \nFine Dining has been hit with a consumer that \u2013 during COVID, we had a lot of growth in Fine Dining. I don't know \nwhat the other brands had, but we had growt h in Fine Dining. And those consumers were not necessarily \nconsumers that we had seen before and they went back to the normal patterns. And so, we don't feel at all that \nthat our size and scale has hurt Fine Dining. In fact, we have even stronger leaders t here when we've got \u2013 now \nwe have a President of the two Fine Dining brands, Capital Grille and Eddie V's, led by John Martin.  \n \nAnd one of our Fine Dining brands that we have is Ruth's Chris, which we've said many times, whenever you had \na brand, we're goi ng to go through some challenges during integration, and that will impact same -restaurant \nsales, and they're one of those. So, we feel really good about where our Fine Dining brands are.  \n \nAnd then lastly, on the decision on Bahama Breeze, we have \u2013 when we  look at our portfolio and we try to \ndetermine what brands we add to our portfolio, we have criteria. And that criteria should be what we look at to \nkeep brands in our portfolio. And we made the decision that Bahama Breeze doesn't meet the criteria anymore , \nand we think that they have a lot of growth potential with another owner. We were not going to be putting a lot of \ninvestment into Bahama Breeze. And so to give those team members and those managers growth opportunities, \nit's better for them to be under a different ownership.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nSara H. Senatore  \nAnalyst, Bank of America  Q \nGot it. Okay. And then just a quick follow up. You had mentioned $150,000 improvement sequentially at Fine \nDining. Is there anything else that you can comment on about the demographics? I mean, one thought is that the \nother benefit that casual dining might be facing is just having less exposure to low -income consumer. So, \nanything \u2013 you've been very helpful in sort of parsing out kind of under $50,000 and sort of some of the dynamics. \nAny updates there?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....

A \nYeah, Sara. I think so from a consumer demographic perspective, let me just kind of parse out a little bit. I think \nwhen you look at casual dining in general, we're seeing growth across most income cohorts. The only group that \nis still soft is the below $50,000 household. And in fact, if you actually look at the $150,000 plus, that's actually \nwhere we're seeing a little bit more growth on casual dini ng. And then when you look at fine dining, you're actually \nseeing pullback with households below $150,000 across. And then only place where we're seeing some growth of \nstabilization is above $150,000 households.  \n \nThe other dynamic with the fine dining spec ifically is that the urban versus suburban that we had discussed, that \nsuburban traffic is actually still at \u2013 running at 95% of pre -COVID levels, so holding up pretty well, but urban is still \nin the low -80s. It's like 82% or something in Q4. So, it's not \u2013 clearly a lot less than where it was before COVID. \nAnd now, I will say one other thing on fine dining and then wrap it up, is just really when you look at their retention \nto pre -COVID, it has stabilized. We're seeing that more stable month -to-month and q uarter -to-quarter over the last \nfew months, so that's a good sign that things are starting to stabilize there.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \n \nOperator : Thanks. Your next question today is coming from Peter Saleh from BTIG. Your line is now live.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nPeter Saleh  \nAnalyst, BTIG LLC  Q \nGreat. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a great quarter. I wanted to ask about the incrementality \nthat you're seeing on the Uber Direct business, the 40% to 50% at Olive Garden. Can you just comment a little bit \nabout who these customers are? Ar e they higher income? I mean, I'm assuming, are they new to the brand or is it \njust increased frequency? Just trying to understand how the customer is using Olive Garden through Uber Direct.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director,  Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah. Peter, right now the delivery customer has very minimal overlap in dining. We are seeing higher guest \nfrequency for delivery versus dine in guests, and a higher percentage of them are new or lapsed guests versus \npickup or  dine in. So, we've got a lot of consumers that haven't been to Olive Garden over a year that are using \nthe delivery service, and nearly 40% of our pickup consumers have tried delivery. And then the last thing on the \nconsumer demographics, they are younger  and slightly higher income, which you would expect.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nPeter Saleh  \nAnalyst, BTIG LLC  Q \nGreat. That's very helpful. And then just lastly on price going forward, I know you're taking less price than inflation. \nWhen you talk about reinvestment, is it \u2013 are y ou considering maybe even taking less price going forward or is it \njust reinvesting back in quality? Just trying to understand kind of the reinvestment comments again, just if you \nguys can elaborate a little bit?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executi ve Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah. Peter, I think those reinvestments can take many forms. And one of them could be pricing even lower than \ninflation. But I think we've got some other places that we can invest and that, as I said, is somewhere in \naffordability. Do we have enough items under a certain price point and in labor? Are we providing the service \nexperience that our guests expect for the prices they're paying?  Darden Restaurants, Inc.

But one of them could be pricing, but I would say \nthat that we've been making that investment for a long time. We'll keep doing that, and we're goi ng to continue to \ndo that, but add some other things.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \n \nOperator : Thanks.

Your line is now live.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nJake Rowland Bartlett  \nAnalyst, Truist Securities, Inc.  Q \nGreat. Thanks for taking th e question. Mine was about the same -store sales guidance in 2026 and how it relates \nto the long term framework. Roughly the same, very similar, but you are seeing this big contributor from delivery \nnow. You have the easy compares. Looks like you talked abo ut good momentum into the quarter or into the first \nquarter here.  \n \nSo, what are some of the offsets? It sounds like you're baking in some conservatism due to the macro \nenvironment or what are you seeing from the macro that's making you maybe a little more cautious there? Any \nmore color on the moving pieces? We can see what's driving some of the strength, but what are you worried \nabout in terms of the headwinds?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRajesh Vennam  \nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nHey, Jake. So, there's a lot in there. So, let me try to unpack. The big, big headline would be we're going to \ncontinue to make reinvestments. And, like, look, if you go back to during COVID, we were pushed very hard to \ntake a lot more pricing when everybody e lse was, and we didn't, and that is paying dividends. And so, we've \ninvested in price. Now, we're going to invest in other places.  \n \nRick talked about different areas where we're going to continue to invest. And we \u2013 like, again, we are not trying \nto achiev e a near term over -earnings to hurt us for the long term. We're just playing the long game. And we \u2013 I \nthink we've earned the credibility over time to show that our strategy works. If you look at over time, the fact that \nwe've been able to deliver double -digit TSR consistently is a testament to the way we operate this business, and \nwe will not deviate from that, and that's really what's reflected in this guidance.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nJake Rowland Bartlett  \nAnalyst, Truist Securities, Inc.  Q \nGreat. My follow up is on G&A. You  were a little higher than guided in 2025, fiscal 2025. Could you give us a hand \non what we should expect for 2026 for G&A?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRajesh Vennam  \nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah. Jake, I think just let me start w ith the first part of why it was a little bit higher in the first \u2013 in this year than \nwhat we thought, that's really mark -to-market. So, because there was such a big run -up in the market, it was an \nincremental impact of about $15 million to $20 million, an d it was offset in taxes, and that's just \u2013 that's why we're \nkind of talking about there is some interaction between G&A and tax, and you got to look them \u2013 look at them \ntogether.  \n Darden Restaurants, Inc.

That includes the \n53rd week. So, if you take out roughly $10 million for the 53rd week, you're looking at a $490 million G&A on a 52 -\nweek basis. And like I just said, there are several factors that can influence what will end up being bec ause \nespecially mark -to-market and then the incentive comp.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \n \nOperator : Thanks. Your next question is coming from Jim Salera from Stephens. Your line is now live.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nJim Salera  \nAnalyst, Stephens, Inc.  Q \nHey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Are you able to give the breakout of traffic and ticket of \nOlive Garden for the quarter? Just trying to size up how much of an impact the Buy One, Take One contributed on \ntransactions? And do you have a sense for if that deal was more of a freque ncy driver among loyal Olive Garden \nguests [ph] or if it kind of (00:53:35) entice new households to come to the brand?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRajesh Vennam  \nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nLet me start with the first part and then w e'll get to the second part in a second. So, from a same -restaurant sales \nbreakdown, at Olive Garden, their pricing was 2.7% and catering grew by about 70 basis points, and then they \nhad \u2013 I mentioned already Uber delivery mix was about 40 basis points, an d then there was a positive mix of \nabout 1%. And so, their underlying traffic was about 2%, a little over 2%. But truly the traffic would be more close \nto 3% if you take into consideration the catering mix.  \n \nFrom a Buy One, Take One, it's just anytime we d o something like that, we do bring in a few new guests, but that \nalso drives frequency. And I think Rick mentioned in the script, we leveraged an existing offer. It actually did not \nhurt our check at all and in our margin. So, you saw that. I mean, Olive G arden printed year -over-year segment \nprofit growth of 100 basis points, and that's where we talk about how we're not deep discounting to just get traffic, \nwe're doing it in ways that's prudent.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nJim Salera  \nAnalyst, Stephens, Inc.  Q \nOkay. Great. And then thinking about 2026, just any comments you can offer on promotional cadence. And you \nmentioned I believe industry discount was up just under 100 basis points in the quarter. And so, it seems like \nconsumer may be gradually improving. Just thoughts on how mu ch we pull on the promotional lever in 2026 to \nkind of support that gradual recovery?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah, Jake. For competitive reasons, I'm not getting into too much detail in  the promotional activity. But I can tell \nyou that if you look at a brand like Olive Garden, what this year demonstrated is that Olive Garden can react to \nwhatever environment they compete in. And so, if the environment gets a little bit more \u2013 less challe nging, maybe \nwe come off of a little promotion activity and make investments in other places.  \n \nIf it gets more challenging, we keep the promotional activity we have. But we like the cadence that we have now. \nRecall that we have Never -Ending Pasta Bowl duri ng a time that's a normal lull in casual dining, and we have Buy \nOne, Take One at the other time this is normal lull in casual dining. But they're not deep discounted and they do \ndrive some traffic.  \n Darden Restaurants, Inc.

John Wilkerson and his team have done a lot of great things to improve and make that brand much \nmore foundationally ready to go. And so, we're testing right now connected television, and t hat's having a good \nimpact. And so, it'll get people to see what Cheddar's has done over these years. So, if you call that promotional \nactivity, that's just marketing their brand. It's not necessarily promotional, but we're going to continue to invest in \nmarketing, whether it's promotional or not.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \n \nOperator : Thanks.

Thanks, guys. I wanted to ask [indiscernible] (00:56:50) and how you are thinking about the strength \n[indiscernible] (00:56:53) gave some color there, Rick, you touched on Uber as well. Just anything at a high level \nthinking about the combination of Uber, new menu, what seems like you've had good succ ess, promos, anything \nelse? So, just the confidence in that momentum running through 2026.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nHey, Jake. You broke up a little bit in the beginning, sorry to say. Ca n you just give us that question again?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nDennis Geiger  \nAnalyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q \nThese work phones are great. Sorry, Rick. Just on Olive Garden momentum. You touched on Uber, but \u2013 yeah, in \nthinking about that momentum into 2026, thinking about the Uber but also the new menu items, the promos, just \nhow you're thinking about the Olive Garden momentum continuing through 2026? Thank you.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah, Dennis. I would s ay Olive Garden has had some strong momentum in the fourth quarter, and that \nmomentum that we have in this quarter is contemplating our guide. And recall what Raj said earlier, our first half \nof the year is probably got a little bit more \u2013 a little easier compares. And so, our first half of the year should be a \nlittle bit better than our second half.  \n \nThat said, we're going to continue to find ways to keep that momentum going. But a brand as big as Olive Garden \nis going to be pretty similar to Darden, so \u2013 where Darden results are. What we're going to do with Uber and if \nUber Direct continues to build as it is, we've got some things that are in test right now in a couple of divisions at \nOlive Garden, perhaps we add it to more divisions and those are investme nts. And so, that would impact our \nsame -restaurant sales.  \n \nSo, if we get more same -restaurant sales from Uber, we may reduce our same -restaurant sales a little bit based \non those tests that we have. It wouldn't necessarily mean that we would go negative, b ut it would reduce the \nimpact of Uber. But for the right reasons, for the long term, as Raj said, we've got a five -year plan and we're \nfocusing on being great today and in 2030.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nDennis Geiger  \nAnalyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q Darden Restaurants, Inc.

And just a quick follow -up. As it relates to that acceleration or that increase in the long term comp guide \nfor the business overall, is that largely delivery driven? Is there anything with any other initiatives? I know you've \ngot to focus on ops and then speed, that's a l ong term focus, anything else?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nNo. I would say that if you look at the long term comp guidance, we're assuming a little bit more inflation over the \nnext five year s than we saw in the first five years. And so, we'll price a little bit below inflation, and that's a big \ncomponent of that. We have \u2013 our long -term framework prior to this assumed in the midpoint that was no traffic \ngrowth that we would have traffic growt h. \n \nOur comps would come from check growth. I mean our new long term framework has the same general \nassumption. So, we think we have a little bit more on price because of inflation, but we'll also have some growth \nbecause of Uber that will help offset some  other things that we're implementing to improve \u2013 continue to improve \nour business for the long term.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \n \nOperator : Thanks.

LLC  Q \nThank you so much, and congrats on a strong quarter. You've reiterated the ongoing resilience in consumers \nabove $50,000 the last few quarters. But I was wondering if there was any notable observation on consumers in \nvarious age groups. So, for example, have you seen better sales trends or higher net purchase intent from \nyounger guests that is driving acceleration across casual dining as well as your major brands? Thank you.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRajesh Vennam  \nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,  Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nHi, Christine. Really it all comes down to the household income. I mean, what we're seeing is that the higher \nincome is actually doing a little bit more than the lower income in general. So, if you look at across our segments, \nas you move up to incomes in the $100,000, $150,000 households, that's where we're seeing more growth than \nother places. And now, it varies from brand to brand. But when you look at it in aggregate, every \u2013 pretty much \nevery household income is growing in casual dining, except for the ones below $50,000 where it's kind of flattish. \nAnd that's really \u2013 the age is really \u2013 it's more about the correlation to income than age.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \n \nOperator : Thanks you.

Thanks for the question. Rick, I guess my question is for you. I guess in the steak category, if I go back 5, 10 \nyears ago, you might have been competing wi th number one player who was more focused on maybe margins, \nand now you're focused \u2013 you're competing with a number one layer that might be a little bit more focused on top \nline. How have you positioned LongHorn to compete? I mean, I'm just trying to figur e out how you're doing comps \nat this level, 6 -and-change. And going forward, do you think you need to reinvest in price? Do you think you need Darden Restaurants, Inc.

I guess I'm trying to figure out how you're going to continue to compete there. \nThanks.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nHey, Greg. LongHorn, the reason they're performing the way they have been is because of their adherence to \ntheir strategy, quality, simplicity and culture. They've made a lot of investments, especially during COVID, \nsignificant investments in all of their items. So, they increased the size of all their stakes. They took a lot less \npricing than inflation. And they're going to continue to focus on that and impr ove the service at LongHorn.  \n \nSo, quality isn't just about food. It's about the overall experience. And so, yeah, they'll keep making those \ninvestments, but not at the detriment of margin. So, we think that LongHorn is well positioned to compete with \ntheir category. There's not as much overlap between the biggest player and LongHorn as you would think on \nconsumer. They go there for different reasons. And so we still feel like we've got a great consumer proposition at \nLongHorn and we would anticipate that co ntinuing, and that's contemplated in our guide and our five -year long \nterm or our long term framework, not our five -year framework, long term.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nGregory Francfort  \nAnalyst, Guggenheim Securities LLC  Q \nThank you.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \n \nOperator : Thank you.

Within \nthat long term framework and a stronger top line focus, how are you thinking about marketing over the next \nseveral years and in 2026 as well? And then the other question was on speed of service, which has been a focus \nfor you. What drivers do you see there for  2026, and can you give us an update on the progress there? Thanks.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah, Andrew. On the marketing front, over the next five years, we anticipate marketing growin g faster than our \nsales, without getting into the total impact of marketing. But as Raj has said in the past, somewhere 10s, 20s of \nbasis points. Raj can get more detail on the next fiscal year. And I'll turn it over to him in a second. But again, \nwe're go ing to continue to invest in marketing, and you'll see more of that in Cheddar's. You'll see more of that \nacross some of our brands. But it's not \u2013 and it'll grow faster than sales.  \n \nWhen you think about speed, we're in the early innings. I know there's a lot of times you got a baseball analogy. \nWe're in the real early innings here. And as I said, when I mentioned speed before, this \u2013 our speed challenges \nhave been a long -time trend in the entire industry. And we will take a good time to reverse that. We've  made \nsome progress. It's not as fast as I'd like it to be, but we've made progress.  \n \nAll of our brands are faster. And what we're really trying to do is ensure that the consumer, we're meeting the \npace that the consumer wants and not holding them hostage in our restaurants.

And we're working on that.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRajesh Vennam  \nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nI think, Rick, you talked about it. So, for fiscal 2026 specifically, we're still talking maybe in the 10 basis points, 20 \nbasis points. I think if you look over the five years, the same thing. Rick already mentioned that. And one thing I'll \njust point out is we don't assume that it's actually a margin drag. The way we look at it is that the investments \nwe're making, we're going to get a return on it, and that keeps the margins fl at. So, I wouldn't view this as a \nmargin erosion.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nAndrew Strelzik  \nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets Corp.

V accaro  \nAnalyst, Raymond James & Associates, Inc.  Q \nHi. Thanks. Most of mine have been asked, but just one quick one. Raj, can you walk through the traffic and \ncheck dynamics at LongHorn as well? Thank you.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRajesh Vennam  \nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nSure, Brian. LongHorn was basically \u2013 their pricing was 3.3%, their traffic was 3.4%, their check was pretty flat to \npricing. So, I think their total was 6.7%, so.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \n \nOperator : Thank you. Next question is comi ng from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nJohn Ivankoe  \nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC  Q \nHi. Thank you. According to the government, overall industry growth in unit, sounds this is the broad industry, \nseems to have slowed from around 2.5% to around 1.5%. So, my question is where do you think that that growth \nrate is changing across the industry and how might that be influencing your ability to access the type of real estate \nthat Darden typically does best with? In other words, make a c omment about the tightening or loosening of the \nspecific sites that you're looking for over the next couple of years.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah, John. We have built a strong pipeline of sites for the next few years. We are in a better position to start this \nfiscal year than we were to start last fiscal year. We feel really good about the work that the team has done, \nincluding new prototypes for Cheddar's and Yard House and finding \u2013 increasing the number of potential sites for \nCheddar's, Yard House, Olive Garden and LongHorn.  \n \nI think your comment on the number of units is restaurant growth. And so, where that's coming \u2013 where the \nslowdown is coming from, I think, is smaller independents and smaller chains. The big chains, like us, continue to Darden Restaurants, Inc.

We've got great access to capital. We've got great cost of capital. And we've shown that we deserve to be \nable to grow.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nJohn Ivankoe  \nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC  Q \nThank you . \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \n \nOperator : Thanks. The next question today is coming from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is now \nlive. \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nJeffrey A. Bernstein  \nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.  Q \nGreat. Thank you. Rick, it sounds like you're more comfortable with the uptick in promotions in recent quarters, I \nknow you guys were previously more hesitant to do any more promotional activity. So \u2013 and I think you mentioned \nfocus more on affordability at Olive Garden going forward to perhaps drive more traffic. I'm just wondering if you \ncould talk a little bit more about that increased confidence in wading into the more value or more affordability side \nof things, and your ability at the same time to still protect margin. And then I had one follow -up. \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, C hief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah, Jeff. If you think about the promotions, it's not like we're promotion crazy here. We added Buy One, Take \nOne, which, as Raj mentioned, wasn't a margin drag. And it was five weeks at a lu ll time. So, it's not like we're \ngoing to go into heavy promotional activity. As we talk about the investments that we're looking at, we're looking \nat a couple of things. One is, as we \u2013 let's double down on affordability at Olive Garden and at other brand s. \n \nAs you think about what we think has been helping somewhat casual dining and definitely us is the price gap \nbetween us and other segments. And so let's keep that moving. Let's get that a little bit stronger. And that would \nmean adding some items on the  menu that may not be the same price points as the ones that are on the menu \ntoday. And so, that would be a mix impact. Whether we promote that or not, I don't know. We may talk about it, \nbut it's not like we're going to \u2013 we think that we're going to have  to have a promotion to do that. We'll talk about it. \nWe'll let our consumers know.  \n \nAnd as I said, we've got some of this in test in a couple of divisions at Olive Garden. It's doing pretty well for us. \nAnd so we feel really good about it, what it's done to our affordability ratings, which we're already strong and what \nit's done for those guests intent to return. So, we feel we're going to \u2013 feel good about the investments we're \nmaking. We wouldn't be making the investments if we didn't think they'd pay of f in the long run.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nJeffrey A. Bernstein  \nAnalyst, Barclays Capital, Inc.  Q \nUnderstood. And then, just as it relates to your competition on the same front, how do you think the industry is \nthinking about discounting versus prior, whether or not they're comfortable with the elevated levels or whether you \nmight see some change there?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A Darden Restaurants, Inc.

All I can \u2013 I mean, I don't know what the industry is thinking about other than what I see. And we've \ngot a player that's been doing some good communication on a good value item and looking at the rest of their \nmenu. They're driving some folks in. I can't say what anybody else is going to do. I can just say that we're ready  to \nreact our way to whatever happens. And we showed that at Olive Garden this year and what we did to continue to \nimprove the profitability at Olive Garden and drive traffic and drive same -restaurant sales.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nJeffrey A.

The next question today is coming from Danilo Gargiulo from Bernstein. Your line is now live.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nDanilo Gargiulo  \nAnalyst, Bernstein Institutional Services LLC  Q \nGreat. Thank you. Rick, I was wondering if you can comment on the labor environment in the United States and \nparticularly whether you've seen any increase in turnover in the areas that you're operating. Maybe not \nnecessarily in your case, but in general in the trade areas that you are most active on, speci fically in light of these \nimmigration policies that seem to be tightening.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah. What I would say is I don't \u2013 we don't get turnover data by market for others. We  know what ours are and \nwe're not really seeing a material impact on turnover or people showing up to work. From day to day, things \nfluctuate in our restaurants. But as of now, nothing material on the top line or on labor. I think it's because we've \ngot su ch a great employment proposition and people want to come to work for us. So, if anyone leaves, we're \nable to fill that job pretty quickly, but we haven't really seen an uptick in turnover. In fact, our brands have been at \nrecord turnover levels, record re tention levels.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nDanilo Gargiulo  \nAnalyst, Bernstein Institutional Services LLC  Q \nOkay. Great to hear. And then regarding your international aspirations, specifically on the franchising side, what \ndo you think your long -term objective might be from \u2013 in terms of like total number of units that you think over the \n5 to even 10 years, you could be aspiring to get to and which areas do you think are going to be getting most \nattention? You mentioned like India, Spain, any other areas that you think could be pa rticularly of interest to you? \nThank you.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nWell, Danilo, we've really started this international push not too long ago, and we're already seeing really great \nresul ts in signing franchise partners. We want to see them build those restaurants. With India, for example, the 40 \nrestaurants are just in one small part of India. We've got a lot of other areas we can go, but we felt it was prudent \nto have that partner prove that they can meet those development commitments in that part of India before we give \nthem another part of India.  \n \nIn regards to Spain, they were really high on Olive Garden. And when signing a 40 restaurant deal, we want to \nsee how they go. There's no gua rantee that all 40 of those restaurants are going to open. Just like there's no Darden Restaurants, Inc.  (DRI) \nQ4 2025 Earnings Call  Corrected Transcript  \n20-Jun-2025   \n \n1-877-FACTSET   www.callstreet.com   25 \nCopyright \u00a9 2001 -2025  FactSet  CallStreet, LLC  \n \nguarantee that the 40 India restaurants are going to open, but we feel really good about our progress. And once \nwe get a restaurant in Spain, what generally happens, let me tak e that back.  \n \nWhat generally happens once we get Olive Garden in a country, those franchise partners realize how good we \nsupport them and they want another brand. And so we'll probably get another brand in those countries if we \nsupport them and they see th e performance. But I'm not going to give you a number of where we're going to be in \nfive years. What I will say is I believe it will be bigger than it is today, and it's already a meaningful business for us \non the profit side with really no capital.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \n \nOperator : Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jim Sanderson from Northcoast Research. Your line is \nnow live.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nJim Sanderson  \nAnalyst, Northcoast Research Partners LLC  Q \nHey. Thanks for the question. I wanted to go back to your fiscal 2026 guidance . So, what closure rate is implied \nfor 2026? And just wondering if you're looking more closely at some of the smaller brands like Seasons 52 or \nEddie V's that haven't really grown that much? If there's an opportunity to streamline your portfolio going forw ard. \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRajesh Vennam  \nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nHey, Jim. I think we basically as part of the five year plan, we went through our portfolio and we closed more than \nnormal this fiscal year. We're not assumin g any significant number of closings next year.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nJim Sanderson  \nAnalyst, Northcoast Research Partners LLC  Q \nAll right. And a quick follow up question on the Uber Direct. You mentioned a promotion in the last part of May \nthat generated significant pickup in delivery. Just wondering, did the incrementality, the 40% to 50%, was that \nconsistent or did you see more new clients coming to the brand, helped by the marketing and promotions for TV \u2013 \non TV?  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \nRicardo Cardenas  \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Dir ector, Darden Restaurants, Inc.  A \nYeah, Jim. It's fairly \u2013 the incrementality is fairly consistent. Recall, when we offer free delivery, we may have \nseen people that are doing current pickup getting delivered. So, I wouldn't say that the incrementality is  going to \nspike because we may have some trade over from our current pickup guests, but it did increase our sales for \ndelivery when we added the commercial.  \n ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ .....  \n \nOperator : Thank you.

All of our restaurants fall within\nthe full-service segment, which is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains. We believe we have strong brands and that the\nbreadth and depth of our experience and expertise sets us apart in the full-service restaurant industry. This collective capability is the product of investments\nover many years in areas that are critical to success in our business, including restaurant operations excellence, brand management excellence, supply chain,\ntalent management and information technology, among other things.\nOur operating philosophy remains focused on strengthening the core operational fundamentals of the business by providing an outstanding guest\nexperience rooted in culinary innovation, attentive service, and engaging atmosphere enabled by our people. Darden enables each brand to reach its full\npotential by leveraging its scale, insights, and experience in a way that protects uniqueness and competitive advantages. Additionally, our brands can capitalize\non data driven insights to deliver customized one-to-one customer relationship marketing. We hold ourselves accountable for operating our restaurants with a\nsense of urgency to achieve our commitments to all of our stakeholders.\nRecent and Planned Restaurant Growth\nDuring fiscal 2025, we added 103 company-owned Chuy\u2019s restaurants and 25 other net new restaurants in the United States.

Our site selection process incorporates\na variety of analytical techniques to evaluate key factors. These factors include trade area demographics, such as target population density and household\nincome levels; competitive influences in the trade area; the site\u2019s visibility, accessibility and traffic volume; and proximity to activity centers such as shopping\nmalls, hotel/motel complexes, offices and universities. Members of senior management evaluate, inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to its\nacquisition. Constructing and opening a new restaurant typically takes approximately 250 days on average after the site is acquired and permits are obtained.\nWe systematically review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards. When a restaurant falls below minimum\nstandards, we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes, and implement operational and marketing plans to improve that restaurant\u2019s performance. If\nperformance does not improve to acceptable levels, the restaurant is evaluated for relocation, closing or conversion to one of our other brands. Permanent\nclosures are typically due to economic changes in trade areas, the expiration of lease agreements, or site concerns. Accordingly, we continue to evaluate our site\nlocations in order to minimize the risk of future closures or asset impairment charges.\nRestaurant Operations\nWe believe that high-quality restaurant management is critical to our long-term success. Our restaurant management structure varies by brand and\nrestaurant size. We issue detailed operations manuals covering all aspects of restaurant operations, as well as food and beverage manuals which detail the\npreparation procedures of our recipes. The restaurant management teams are responsible for the day-to-day operation of each restaurant and for ensuring\ncompliance with our operating standards.\nEach Olive Garden restaurant is led by a General Manager, and each LongHorn Steakhouse and Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen restaurant is led by a\nManaging Partner. Each also has three to six additional managers, depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant. In addition, each\nrestaurant typically employs between 35 to 200 hourly team members, most of whom work part-time. Restaurant General Managers or Managing Partners\nreport to a Director of Operations who is responsible for approximately five to eleven restaurants. Each Director of Operations reports to a Divisional Vice\nPresident of Operations who is responsible for between 80 and 120 restaurants. From time to time, we deploy Senior Directors of Operations in our large\nbrands to oversee up to five Directors of Operations and assist with succession planning. Restaurants are visited regularly by operations management, including\nofficer-level executives, to help ensure strict adherence to our standards and to solicit feedback on opportunities for improvement.\nEach Yard House, Ruth\u2019s Chris, The Capital Burger and Bahama Breeze restaurant is led by a General Manager, and each The Capital Grille, Seasons 52,\nEddie V\u2019s and The Capital Burger restaurant is led by a Managing Partner. Each also has three to ten additional managers. Each Yard House, Ruth\u2019s Chris, The\nCapital Grille, Seasons 52 and Eddie V\u2019s restaurant has one executive chef, and some have one to two sous chefs. Each Bahama Breeze and The Capital Burger\nrestaurant has one to three culinary managers. In addition, each restaurant typically employs between 50 to 200 hourly team members, most of whom work\npart-time. The General Manager or Managing Partner of each restaurant reports directly to a Director of Operations, who has operational responsibility for\napproximately three to eleven restaurants. Restaurants are visited regularly by operations\n6management, including officer-level executives, to help ensure strict adherence to our standards and to solicit feedback on opportunities for improvement.\nEach Chuy\u2019s restaurant is led by a General Manager. Each restaurant has a First Assistant, Kitchen Manager and an additional one to three managers,\ndepending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant. In addition, each restaurant typically employs between 60 to 120 hourly team\nmembers, most of whom work part-time. Restaurant General Managers report to an Area Supervisor who is responsible for approximately four to seven\nrestaurants. Each Area Supervisor reports to a Senior Director of Operations who is responsible for between 30 \u2013 40 restaurants. Restaurants are visited\nregularly by operations management, including officer-level executives, to help ensure strict adherence to our standards and to solicit feedback on opportunities\nfor improvement.\nOur Learning and Development team in partnership with each brand\u2019s training leader, together with senior operations executives, is responsible for\ndeveloping and maintaining our operations training programs. These efforts include an eight to twelve-week training program for management trainees and\ncontinuing development programs for all levels of leadership. The emphasis of the training and development programs varies by restaurant brand, but includes\nleadership effectiveness, restaurant business management and culinary skills. We also use a highly structured training program to open new restaurants,\nincluding deploying training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations. The opening training teams typically begin work one to two weeks prior\nto opening and remain at the new restaurant for up to three weeks after the opening. They are re-deployed as appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the\nrestaurant\u2019s operating staff.\nWe maintain performance measurement and incentive compensation programs for our management-level team members. We believe that our leadership\nposition, strong results-oriented culture and various short-term and long-term incentive programs, including stock-based compensation, enhance our ability to\nattract and retain highly motivated restaurant managers.\nQuality Assurance\nOur Total Quality Department helps ensure that all restaurants provide safe, high-quality food in a clean and safe environment.\nThrough rigorous supplier and risk-based product evaluations, we purchase only products that meet or exceed our product specifications. We rely on\nindependent third parties to inspect and evaluate our suppliers and distributors. Suppliers that produce \u201chigh-risk\u201d ready-to-eat products are subject to a food\nsafety evaluation by Darden personnel at least annually. We require our suppliers to maintain sound manufacturing practices and operate with comprehensive\nHazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) food safety programs and risk-based preventative controls adopted by the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration. These programs focus on preventing hazards that could cause food-borne illnesses by applying scientifically-based controls to analyze hazards,\nidentify and monitor critical control points, and establish corrective actions when monitoring shows that a critical limit has not been met.\nThird party auditors inspect each restaurant regularly throughout the year to assess food safety and sanitation practices. Our total quality team verifies the\napplication of preventative controls through on-site support visits ensuring an effective and robust food safety system. Total quality managers provide support\nto operations staff with education and training in food safety and sanitation. The team also serves as a liaison to regulatory agencies on issues relating to food\nsafety.\nSourcing and Distribution\nEnsuring available, safe, high-quality food and supplies at competitive prices to all our restaurants depends on reliable sources of procurement. Our\nsourcing staff sources, negotiates, and purchases food and supplies from more than 1,400 suppliers whose products originate in more than 30 countries.\nSuppliers must meet our strict quality control standards in the development, harvest, catch and production of food products. We leverage competitive bids,\nlong-term contracts and strategic supplier relationships to manage availability and cost of products.\nWe contribute to Darden\u2019s scale advantage, by directly sourcing product utilizing our supplier relationships, product expertise, dedicated distribution\nnetwork, while prioritizing food safety. Our staff travels routinely within the United States and internationally to source top-quality food and supplies at\ncompetitive prices. We actively engage with and monitor our suppliers, both in person and remotely, including hosting virtual visits and audits. We have\nexcellent long-term relationships with key suppliers and usually source our product directly from producers.\n7We enter into long-term agreements with multiple third-party national distribution companies to deliver food and supplies to our restaurants. Under these\narrangements we maintain ownership of the food and supplies inventory through our subsidiary Darden Direct Distribution, Inc. (Darden Direct), managed by\nthird-party distribution partners. Because of the rapid turnover of perishable food products, inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value\nin relation to sales.\nWe continue to drive automation of our supply chain by collaborating with our suppliers, logistics partners and distributors to improve optimization with\ninformation visibility and other technological advances. These and other terms of Darden Direct\u2019s long-term supply agreements further enable our sourcing\nstaff to integrate demand forecasts into our purchasing operations, driving efficiencies in our operations.\nIntegrated Marketing\nOur restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers. To further strengthen our brands, we focus on highlighting what makes each one unique.\nAccordingly, our brands evaluate each marketing activity through three filters. The first filter involves elevating brand equity by bringing each brand\u2019s\ncompetitive advantages to life. The second filter is simple execution, allowing our teams to deliver consistently memorable guest experiences. And finally, it\nwill not be at a deep discount. We are focused on providing great value to our guests but doing so in a way that drives profitable sales growth.\nIntegrated marketing is key to bringing our brands to life, and our scale enables us to be a leading advertiser in the full-service dining segment of the\nrestaurant industry. Olive Garden leverages the efficiency of national advertising, on both traditional and streaming television, supplemented with targeted\ndigital media investments. LongHorn Steakhouse, Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen, Yard House, Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House, The Capital Grille, Chuy\u2019s, Seasons 52,\nEddie V\u2019s and Bahama Breeze also use digital marketing to build engagement and loyalty.\nIn fiscal 2025, we continued a multi-year effort to implement new technology platforms that allow us to digitally engage with our guests and team\nmembers and strengthen our marketing and analytics capabilities. We also continued making improvements to our online and mobile ordering and payment\nsystems across all our brands. In addition, we continued working on developing sophisticated customer relationship management programs, data analytics and\ndata-driven marketing approaches to effectively and efficiently target our existing and potential guests across our portfolio of brands. This enables us to tailor\nour messaging and offerings depending on guest visit history, preferences and brand loyalty. Finally, we have developed and consistently use sophisticated\nconsumer marketing research to monitor guest satisfaction and evolving trends and marketplace dynamics.\nHuman Capital\nWe prioritize our team members through our People Strategy that includes four strategic imperatives:\n\u2022Hire - Attract and select diverse team members that reflect our values and are committed to our results-oriented culture;\n\u2022Train - Teach team members to perform in today\u2019s environment and develop the skills to meet tomorrow\u2019s needs;\n\u2022Reward - Invest in compelling programs that recognize team members when goals are achieved and further motivate our culture of winning; and\n\u2022Retain - Keep team members engaged and motivated, ready to deliver results and grow their careers.\nWe closely track and assess a variety of metrics that help us evaluate our performance on each of these imperatives.\nHire. We are committed to attracting, engaging, developing and retaining a workforce that mirrors the diversity of our guests and the communities in\nwhich we operate. We track a variety of workforce statistics to help us understand the gender, racial and ethnic diversity of our team members. Key team\nmember statistics as of the end of fiscal 2025 included the following:\nTotal team members (hourly and salaried) 197,924\nTotal number of hourly team members 186,993\nPercent of hourly team members \u2013 female 58%\nPercent of hourly team members \u2013 members of racial or ethnic minority groups 57%\nTotal number of new hires of hourly team members during fiscal 2025 139,210\n8Percent of hourly new hires \u2013 female 57%\nPercent of hourly new hires \u2013 members of racial or ethnic minority groups 56%\nIn addition to the gender, racial and ethnic diversity of our workforce, our team members are also very diverse in age; we employ members of five\ngenerations of the United States population: Traditionalists, Baby Boomers, Generation X, Millennials and Centennials. We provide our EEO-1 report on our\nwebsite at www.darden.com.\nTrain. We succeed because of our people, and with our success come rewards, recognition and great opportunities for our team members. We regularly\ninvest in our team members\u2019 careers by providing the tools they need to succeed in their current roles, to grow personally and professionally, and to deliver\nexceptional experiences to our guests each day. With thousands of leadership positions across our restaurants, we provide a pathway and training for thousands\nof individuals across the country to advance from entry-level jobs into management roles. In fiscal 2025, 61% of the participants in our restaurant Manager In\nTraining program were internal promotions, and 99% of the new General Managers or Managing Partners were internal promotions.\nReward. We believe that we provide working conditions and pay and benefits that compare favorably with those of our competitors. Most team members,\nother than restaurant management and corporate management, are paid on an hourly basis. We offer our team members flexible work schedules and\ncompetitive pay and benefits, including paid sick leave and access to free counseling through our employee assistance program for team members and their\nfamilies.\nWe regularly review our pay and benefits programs to identify and implement enhancements to the ways we reward our team members. Since fiscal 2022,\nwe have maintained a policy that each hourly restaurant team member company-wide would earn a minimum hourly wage of at least $12 per hour, inclusive of\ntip income. For fiscal 2025, across all of our brands, our hourly team members earned, on average, $24 per hour, inclusive of tip income, far exceeding that\nminimum wage. Since fiscal 2018, we have significantly increased the percentage of medical premium contributions we make on behalf of our team members.\nIn fiscal 2025, we subsidized 75-81% (depending on the plan and tier selected) of the premiums for our team members, representing a 17-28% increase in the\npercentage of medical premiums we contributed as compared to fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2025, we invested approximately $12 million to continue to maintain\ncompetitive premiums for our team members.\nFurther, in fiscal 2025, the Darden Restaurants Foundation continued the Next Course Scholarship program for children and dependents of our team\nmembers that launched during fiscal 2023. In its third year, the program awarded scholarships worth $3,000 each to 98 children or dependents of Darden team\nmembers. In January 2023, we introduced a new benefit for restaurant team members called Fast Fluency. For many of our team members, English is not their\nfirst language, and this program provides the opportunity to learn English for free.\nNone of our team members are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our team member relations to be good. We conduct\nengagement surveys with hourly team members and management twice a year through Gallup, and Darden\u2019s overall engagement is well above the average for\nboth U.S. and international companies as measured by Gallup.\nConsistent with our core values of respect, caring and teamwork, in fiscal 1999, we established a program called Darden Dimes to help fellow Darden\nteam members in need. Darden Dimes provides short-term financial grants to team members experiencing financial need caused by unexpected emergencies or\ncatastrophic natural disasters. Participating team members donate as little as 10 cents from each paycheck to the Darden Dimes fund, which raised over $2.6\nmillion and granted $2.8 million in fiscal 2025.\nRetain. As a full-service restaurant company, food is always top of mind, but our team members make the difference: they are at the heart of everything\nwe do. We believe the guest experience can never exceed the team member experience, so we strive to hire the best individuals and retain them by fostering an\nenvironment of respect and inclusion, where diversity of thought and background is valued and everyone has the opportunity to develop and grow their careers.\nIn addition, our geographic footprint often puts us in a position to offer our restaurant team members jobs in their current roles when personal circumstances\nrequire relocation.\nDarden\u2019s consolidated turnover rate for hourly team members during fiscal 2025 was 67%, one of the lowest rates in the restaurant industry. Each of our\nbrands experienced a turnover rate during fiscal 2025 that was lower than the most recent relevant\n9casual dining or fine dining turnover rate for their segment of the industry as reported in The People Reportby Black Box Intelligence. Darden\u2019s\nconsolidated restaurant management turnover rate of 16% was also significantly lower than the broader restaurant industry benchmark. Our executive\nleadership (vice president and above) has an average of over 20 years of experience with Darden, while our restaurant General Managers and Managing\nPartners have an average of 15 years of experience with us.\nInformation Technology and Cybersecurity\nWe strive for leadership in the restaurant business by using technology as a competitive advantage and as an enabler of our strategy. We have\nimplemented technology-enabled business solutions to improve financial control, cost management, guest service and employee effectiveness, as well as enable\ne-commerce. These solutions are designed to be used across restaurant brands, yet are flexible enough to meet the unique needs of each restaurant brand. Our\nstrategy is to fully integrate systems to drive operational efficiencies and enable restaurant teams to focus on restaurant operations excellence. Restaurant\nhardware and software support for our restaurant brands is provided or coordinated from our restaurant support center facility in Orlando, Florida. Our data\ncenter contains sufficient computing power to process information from restaurants quickly and efficiently. We leverage public cloud computing where\nappropriate to enhance our capabilities and to leverage scale. Our information is processed in a secure environment to protect both our data and the physical\ncomputing assets. We guard against business interruption by maintaining a disaster recovery plan, which includes storing critical business information off-site,\ntesting the disaster recovery plan annually and providing on-site power backup. We periodically engage third parties to perform cybersecurity audits utilizing\nthe National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework. We also engage third parties to conduct security reviews of our network,\nprocesses and systems on a regular basis. We use internally developed proprietary software, cloud-based software as a service (SaaS), as well as purchased\nsoftware, with proven, non-proprietary hardware.\nOur brands share a secure, robust digital platform with online ordering and other guest-facing capabilities. We also have deployed mobile applications\nwith online ordering and other features for most of our casual dining brands and specialty restaurant brands. We successfully leverage these digital capabilities\nto address evolving guest needs. We will continue to invest in these platforms and applications to enhance the guest experience.\nWe maintain a robust system of data protection and cybersecurity resources, technology and processes. We regularly evaluate new and emerging risks and\never-changing legal and compliance requirements. We make strategic investments to address these risks, including maintaining insurance coverage to mitigate\nthe potential financial consequences of cybersecurity incidents, and compliance requirements to keep Company, guest and team member data secure. We\nmonitor risks of sensitive information compromise at our business partners where relevant and reevaluate these risks on a periodic basis. We also perform\nannual and ongoing cybersecurity awareness training for our restaurant management and restaurant support center team members. In addition, we provide\nannual credit card handling training following Payment Card Industry (PCI) guidelines to team members who handle guest credit cards.\nOur management believes that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates position us well to support current needs and future\ngrowth. We use a strategic information systems multi-year planning process that involves senior management and is integrated into our overall business\nplanning. We provide data protection and cybersecurity reports to the Audit Committee of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, which has\noversight of risks related to cybersecurity threats. These reports are also provided periodically to the full Board of Directors. Information systems projects are\nprioritized based upon strategic, financial, regulatory, risk and other business advantage criteria.\nCompetition\nThe restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food, price, service, restaurant location, personnel, brand,\nattractiveness of facilities, availability of carryout and home delivery, internet and mobile ordering capabilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing.\nThe restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes; national, regional or local economic conditions; demographic trends; traffic patterns;\nthe type, number and location of competing restaurants; and consumers\u2019 discretionary purchasing power. We compete within each market with national and\nregional chains and locally-owned restaurants for guests, management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites. In addition, expanding product\nofferings at fast casual and quick-service restaurants and the convenience of home delivery services, together with negative economic conditions, could cause\nconsumers to choose less expensive alternatives or reduce the frequency of their restaurant visits. We expect intense competition to continue in all of these\nareas.TM TM\n10Other factors pertaining to our competitive position in the industry are addressed under the sections entitled \u201cSourcing and Distribution,\u201d \u201cIntegrated\nMarketing\u201d and \u201cInformation Technology and Cybersecurity\u201d in this Item 1 and in our Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nTrademarks and Service Marks\nWe regard our Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen, Chuy\u2019s, Yard House, Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House, The Capital\nGrille, Seasons 52, Eddie V\u2019s Prime SeafoodBahama Breeze, The Capital Burger, Dardenand Darden Restaurantsservice marks, and other service\nmarks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses, as having significant value and as being important to our marketing efforts. Our policy is to pursue\nregistration of our important service marks and trademarks and to vigorously oppose any infringement of them. Generally, with appropriate renewal and use,\nthe registration of our service marks and trademarks will continue indefinitely.\nFranchises, Joint Ventures and New Business Development\nAs of May 25, 2025, we owned and operated 2,159 restaurants through subsidiaries in the United States and Canada. We own all of those locations,\nexcept for 5 restaurants we manage through joint venture or other contractual agreements. In all instances, we maintain control over the use of our service\nmarks and receive management fees, which are not material to our consolidated financial statements.\nAs of May 25, 2025, franchisees operated 85 franchised restaurants in the United States and 69 franchised restaurants outside of the United States. We\nhave area development, franchise and/or license agreements in place with unaffiliated operators to develop and operate Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse,\nCheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen, Yard House, Ruth\u2019s Chris, The Capital Grille and Bahama Breeze restaurants in the following regions:\n\u2022United States (including Puerto Rico and Guam),\n\u2022Canada,\n\u2022Mexico,\n\u2022Central and South America (Brazil, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala and Panama),\n\u2022Asia (Philippines, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Indonesia, Singapore, Japan and India)\n\u2022Caribbean (Aruba, Jamaica, Bahamas, Barbados and Cayman Islands),\n\u2022Europe (Spain)\n\u2022Middle East (Saudi Arabia and Qatar).\nThe open and operating franchised restaurants are all reflected in the table under the \u201cIntroduction\u201d section of this Item 1. We do not have an ownership\ninterest in any of these franchisees, but we receive fees under the area development and franchise agreements and royalty income under the franchise or license\nagreements. The amount of income we derive from our franchise arrangements is not material to our consolidated financial statements.\nThe restaurants operating under contractual agreements are also reflected in the table under the \u201cIntroduction\u201d section of this Item 1. We do not have an\nownership interest in any of these locations, but we receive incentive and royalty fees under the management agreements. The amount of income we derive\nfrom our managed agreement arrangements is not material to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe license the sales and distribution of several items including Olive Garden salad dressings, salad croutons and seasoning through various channels\nincluding wholesale distribution chains and major grocery chains. The amount of income we derive from these licensing arrangements is not material to our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nSeasonality\nOur sales volumes have historically fluctuated seasonally. Our average sales per restaurant are highest in the winter and spring, followed by the fall and\nsummer. Holidays, changes in the economy, severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions. Because of\nthe historical seasonality of our business and these other factors, results for any fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved\nfor the full fiscal year.\u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\u00ae \u00ae \u00ae, \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \n11Government Regulation\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws affecting our business. Each of our restaurants must comply with licensing\nrequirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which a\nrestaurant is located. The development and operation of restaurants depend on selecting and acquiring suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use,\nenvironmental, traffic and other regulations. To date, we have not been significantly affected by any difficulty, delay or failure to obtain required licenses or\napprovals.\nDuring fiscal 2025, 10.6 percent of our sales were attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages. Regulations governing the sale of alcoholic beverages\nrequire licensure by each site (in most cases, on an annual basis), and licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. These regulations relate to\nmany aspects of restaurant operations, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory\ncontrol and handling, and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. In recent years, many states have modified their regulations to permit \u201cTo Go\u201d sales\nof alcoholic beverages, and in some locations we now offer a variety of alcoholic beverages to go, including in bottles, from draft and mixed drinks. The failure\nof a restaurant to obtain or retain alcoholic beverage licenses or to comply with regulations governing the sale of alcoholic beverages would adversely affect a\nrestaurant\u2019s operations. We also are subject in certain states to \u201cdram shop\u201d statutes, which generally provide an injured party with recourse against an\nestablishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person who then causes injury to himself or a third party. We carry liquor liability coverage as\npart of our comprehensive general liability insurance.\nWe also are subject to federal, state and local minimum wage laws and other laws governing such matters as overtime, tip credits, working conditions,\npaid leave, safety standards, and hiring and employment practices. In April 2024, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) announced updates to the Fair Labor\nStandards Act overtime rules that, in two stages, one on July 1, 2024 and a second on January 1, 2025 increase the salary threshold above which non-exempt\nworkers are required to be paid overtime. In November 2024, a federal judge in Texas struck down the DOL's proposed rule. As a result, the salary thresholds\nreverted to the 2019 rule, resetting the white-collar and highly compensated employee exemptions at $35,568 and $107,432, respectively.\nSince 1995, Darden has had a Tip Rate Alternative Commitment (TRAC) agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  TRAC requirements,\nwhich include increased educational and other efforts in each restaurant to increase the reporting compliance of employees with respect to cash tips, are applied\nacross all of our brands.  Compliance with TRAC requirements reduces the likelihood of potential employer-only FICA tax assessments related to cash tips that\nare unreported by employees at Darden\u2019s covered units. Consistent with our long-standing agreement with the IRS, we work proactively with IRS personnel\nresponsible for tip compliance to ensure that we are taking the appropriate steps to continue to meet our TRAC obligations.\nWe are subject to federal and state environmental regulations, but these rules have not had a material effect on our operations. During fiscal 2025, there\nwere no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and [no material expenditures for this purpose are anticipated].\nOur facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and related state accessibility statutes.\nUnder the ADA and related state laws, we must provide equivalent service to disabled persons and make reasonable accommodation for their employment, and\nwhen constructing or undertaking significant remodeling of our restaurants, we must make those facilities accessible.\nWe are subject to federal and state regulations relating to employer-provided health insurance, but these rules have not had a material effect on our\noperations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product safety, nutritional content and\nmenu labeling. We are subject to laws and regulations requiring disclosure of calorie, fat, trans fat, salt and allergen content.\nWe are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit, protection and fraud. An increasing number of\ngovernments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information, including social\nsecurity numbers, financial information (including credit card numbers), and health information. As a merchant and service provider of point-of-sale services,\nwe are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard issued by the Payment Card Industry Council (PCI DSS).\nWe are subject to anti-corruption laws in the United States and in the international jurisdictions where we do business, including the Foreign Corrupt\nPractices Act. We are also subject to a variety of international laws relating to franchising and licensing of intellectual property in the various countries across\nthe world where we are engaged in franchising our restaurant brands.\n12See Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d below for a discussion of risks relating to federal, state and local regulation of our business, including in the areas of data\nprivacy and environmental matters.\nSustainability\nThe sustainability of our food sources and restaurant operations is a key component of providing great service and food to our guests. During fiscal 2025,\nwe remained focused on our climate strategy, restaurant sustainability metrics and Darden\u2019s Animal Welfare Council. We will continue to adapt our\nsustainability approach with development or enhancement of integrated and strategic priorities in the near term across our operations, from the food we source\nto the operation of our restaurants.\nDarden manages energy and water conservation within our restaurant operations and engages with our supply chain partners on sustainability topics\nincluding climate, water, deforestation and animal welfare. In fiscal 2025, Darden continued to develop our understanding, measurement systems and relevant\ndisclosures in our priority focus areas. Additional environmental indicators, including energy and water consumption, waste generation and diversion, as well\nas Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, are reported on our website at www.darden.com/our-impact/communities/sustainability.\nGreenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions\nFiscal Year Ended\n(in metric tons CO2e) May 25, 2025 May 26, 2024 May 28, 2023\nAverage Per Restaurant 380 400 410\nTotal - Scope 1 and 2 833,462 818,117 785,862 \n(1)As of fiscal 2024, GHG reporting is for the same fiscal year for which current financial results are included in this report. Above emissions are for owned\nand operated restaurants only. Franchises are accounted for in our Scope 3 inventory.\n(2)GHG Emissions per Restaurant Intensity Ratio includes only Scope 1 and 2 totals (as defined in the Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard of the\nGHG Protocol) divided by the total number of restaurants at the end of each fiscal year.\n(3)APEX Companies, LLC provided statements of third-party verification to a limited assurance level for the above stated values for the fiscal years ended\n2025, 2024 and 2023 in accordance with ISO Standard 14064-3 Second edition 2019-4 on greenhouse gases- Part 3: Specification with guidance for the\nverification and validation of GHG statements.\nWe shared Darden\u2019s Food Principles in 2016 to outline our commitment to guests in areas of sustainable sourcing, nutritional disclosure, food safety and\nanimal welfare. Darden\u2019s Food Principles connect each of these strategic business efforts in a guest-centered platform, including sourcing and ingredient\ncommitments to our guests. We continue to work with our supplier partners to make progress in these focus areas, and we provide annual updates on our efforts\nin the Sustainability section of our website, www.darden.com.\nBuilding on our Food Principles, Darden established an Animal Welfare Policy that adopts an outcomes-based approach to continue to ensure a high level\nof care for farm animals in our food supply chain. To implement this policy, we established an Animal Welfare Council consisting of leading academics and\nthought leaders with expertise in the care of animals in food supply chains. The Council advises and supports the Company on our efforts to advance strategy\nand implementation of an outcomes-based approach to animal welfare, from supplier collaborations to reporting improvements.\nMore information about our sustainability strategy, our commitment to our guests on Food Principles and our progress to date is available at\nwww.darden.com.\nDarden Foundation and Community Affairs\nWe are recognized for a culture that rewards caring for and responding to people. That defines service for Darden. The Darden Restaurants, Inc.\nFoundation (the Foundation) works to bring this spirit of service to life through its philanthropic support of charitable organizations across the country and\nsupport for the volunteer involvement of our team members. The Foundation does this by focusing its philanthropic efforts on programs that enhance the\ncommunities where our team members and guests live and work. In addition, team members at our Restaurant Support Center are eligible for 16 hours per\ncalendar year of paid time for approved community service activities during scheduled work hours.\nIn fiscal 2025, the Foundation awarded approximately $4.0 million in grants to national organizations as well as local nonprofits, including Second\nHarvest Food Bank of Central Florida and the Heart of Florida United Way. These organizations(1)\n(3)\n(2)\n(3)\n13provide service to the public through hunger relief, community investment, and the promotion of career opportunities in the culinary industry.\nThe Foundation continues to invest in mobile food pantry programs through its long-standing partnership with Feeding America. In fiscal 2025, the\nFoundation awarded a $2.0 million grant to provide refrigerated box trucks to help Feeding America increase access to nutritious food and address\ntransportation needs at food banks that are under-resourced and serve communities with high percentages of food insecurity. Over five consecutive years, the\nFoundation has funded more than 50 vehicles to meet the increasing demand for food assistance in communities where we operate. The most recent donation\nmarks a total of $20.3 million that the Foundation and Darden have contributed to the Feeding America network since 2010.\nOur support of Feeding America and the fight against hunger complement our Darden Harvest program, which began in 2003 as a mechanism for\ndelivering fresh and healthy food to people who need it. Each day, our restaurants collect surplus, wholesome food that is not served to guests and, rather than\ndiscarding the food, they prepare it for donation to local nonprofit feeding partners. In fiscal 2025, Darden contributed approximately 6 million pounds of food,\nthe equivalent of 5 million meals provided to people in need across the communities served by our restaurants. As an added benefit of the Darden Harvest\nprogram, we are able to divert millions of pounds of surplus food from waste streams every year.\nThe Foundation\u2019s funding helps support the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation\u2019s ProStart program, a national high school program\nthat introduces students to the restaurant industry and provides them with an industry-driven curriculum on topics ranging from culinary techniques to\nmanagement skills. The Foundation\u2019s fiscal 2025 contribution of $250,000 also supports the Restaurant Ready program to engage and encourage disconnected\nyoung people to pursue a path to employment and improve their quality of life.\nWe are also a proud member of the American Red Cross\u2019 Annual Disaster Giving Program, which enables the Red Cross to respond to the needs of\nindividuals and families impacted by disasters anywhere in the United States. In fiscal 2025, the Foundation provided $500,000 to the American Red Cross for\nthe program. In addition to financial support, our restaurants donate meals to feed first responders and victims of natural disasters.\nIn fiscal 2025, the Foundation supported the third annual Next Course Scholarship program to help the children or dependents of Darden team members\nreach their educational goals. The Foundation has partnered with Scholarship America to administer the initiative, which provided scholarships for post-\nsecondary education to children or dependents of eligible full-time and part-time Darden team members for the 2025-26 academic year. As a result, 98 children\nor dependents of Darden team members were awarded scholarships worth $3,000 each. These team members represent more than 90 different restaurants\nacross eight of our brands and 31 states.\nMore information about the Foundation and its efforts to enhance the quality of life in the communities where we do business is available on our website\nat www.darden.com.\nItem 1A. RISK FACTORS\nVarious risks and uncertainties could affect our business. Any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this report or our other filings with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. It is not possible to predict or\nidentify all risk factors. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business\noperations.\nRisks Relating to Inflation and Macroeconomic Disruption\nA failure to address cost pressures, including rising costs for commodities, labor, health care and utilities used by our restaurants, and a failure to\neffectively deliver cost management activities and achieve economies of scale in purchasing could compress our margins and adversely affect our sales and\nresults of operations.\nOur results of operations depend significantly on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the price and availability of food, ingredients, labor,\nhealth care, utilities, fuel and other related costs over which we may have little control. While inflationary conditions have somewhat abated in recent periods,\nwe have experienced and continue to experience higher than normal inflationary conditions with respect to most or all of these costs during fiscal 2025.\nOperating margins for our restaurants are subject to changes in the price and availability of food commodities, including beef, pork, chicken, seafood, cheese,\nbutter and produce. The introduction of or changes to tariffs or adverse impacts resulting from restrictive trade policies or trade disputes on imported food\nproducts, such as produce and seafood, could increase our costs and possibly impact the supply of those products.\n14We cannot predict whether we will continue to be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices, menu offerings, and\nmenu prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results. We attempt to leverage our size to achieve economies of scale in purchasing,\nbut there can be no assurances that we can always do so effectively. We are also subject to the general risks of inflation and its impact on the macroeconomic\nenvironment.\nIncreases in minimum wage, health care and other benefit costs may have a material adverse effect on our labor costs. We operate in many states and\nlocalities where the minimum wage is significantly higher than the federal minimum wage. The market for labor in the United States is competitive and has\nresulted in pressure on wages and may continue to do so in the future. Increases in minimum wage and market pressure may also result in increases in the wage\nrates paid for non-minimum wage positions. Many states and localities are also passing laws regulating employment practices and working conditions, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our labor costs in those areas.\nOur restaurants\u2019 operating margins are also affected by fluctuations in the price of utilities such as electricity and natural gas, whether as a result of\ninflation or otherwise, on which the restaurants depend for their energy supply. In addition, interruptions to the availability of gas, electric, water or other\nutilities, whether due to aging infrastructure, weather conditions, fire, animal damage, trees, digging accidents, geopolitical impacts or other reasons largely out\nof our control, may adversely affect our operations. Our inability to anticipate and respond effectively to an adverse change in any of these factors could have a\nsignificant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nCertain economic and business factors and their impacts on the restaurant industry and other general macroeconomic factors, including unemployment,\nenergy prices and interest rates that are largely beyond our control may adversely affect consumer behavior and our sales and results of operations.\nOur business results depend on a number of industry-specific and general economic factors, many of which are beyond our control, and may adversely\naffect consumer behavior and our sales and our results of operations. The full-service dining sector of the restaurant industry is affected by changes in\ninternational, national, regional and local economic conditions, seasonal fluctuation of sales volumes, consumer spending patterns and consumer preferences,\nincluding changes in consumer tastes and dietary habits, and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant brands. The performance of individual\nrestaurants may also be adversely affected by factors such as demographic trends, severe weather including hurricanes, traffic patterns and the type, number\nand location of competing restaurants.\nGeneral economic conditions, including slow global recovery from economic downturns, geopolitical conditions and uncertainty about the strength or\npace of economic recovery, have also adversely affected our results of operations and may continue to do so. Economic recession, a protracted economic\nslowdown, a worsening economy, political instability, increased unemployment, increased inflation, increased energy prices, rising interest rates, a downgrade\nof the U.S. government\u2019s long-term credit rating, imposition of retaliatory tariffs on important U.S. imports and exports or other industry-wide cost pressures\nhave affected and can continue to affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining occasions and lead to a decline in sales and earnings. Economic\nuncertainty has caused and may continue to cause guests to make fewer discretionary purchases, and any significant decrease in our guest traffic or average\nprofit per transaction will negatively impact our financial performance. In addition, if gasoline, natural gas, electricity and other energy costs remain at the\ncurrent elevated levels or increase further, and credit card, home mortgage and other borrowing costs increase with rising interest rates, our guests may have\nlower disposable income and reduce the frequency of their dining occasions, may spend less on each dining occasion or may choose more inexpensive food\noptions.\nFurthermore, we cannot predict the effects that actual or threatened armed conflicts, including the ongoing armed conflicts in the Ukraine and the Middle\nEast, terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism, heightened security requirements, or a failure to protect information systems for critical infrastructure, such\nas the electrical grid and telecommunications systems, could have on our operations, the economy or consumer confidence generally. Any of these events could\naffect consumer spending patterns or result in increased costs for us due to security measures.\nUnfavorable changes in the above factors or in other business and economic conditions affecting our guests could increase our costs, reduce traffic in\nsome or all of our restaurants or impose practical limits on pricing, any of which could lower our profit margins and have a material adverse effect on our sales,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Human Capital\nThe inability to hire, train, reward and retain restaurant team members and determine and maintain adequate staffing may impact our ability to achieve\nour operating, growth and financial objectives.\nOur long-term growth depends substantially on our ability to recruit and retain high-quality team members to work in and manage our restaurants.\nAdequate staffing and retention of qualified restaurant team members is a critical factor impacting our\n15guests\u2019 experience in our restaurants. Maintaining adequate staffing in our existing restaurants and hiring and training staff for our new restaurants require\nprecise workforce planning which has been complicated by the competitive labor market in the United States. The market for the most qualified talent\ncontinues to be competitive, and we must provide competitive wages, benefits and workplace conditions to maintain our most qualified team members. A\nshortage of qualified candidates who meet all legal citizenship or work authorization requirements, failure to recruit and retain new team members in a timely\nmanner or higher than expected turnover levels all could affect our ability to open new restaurants, grow sales at existing restaurants or meet our labor cost\nobjectives. Anticipated changes in immigration laws and regulations could decrease the pool of candidates with legal work authorizations, cause disruption in\nthe workforce for all companies that rely on hourly workers and increase the costs, time and requirements to hire new employees. An inability to adequately\nmonitor and proactively respond to team member dissatisfaction could lead to poor guest satisfaction, higher turnover, litigation and unionization, which could\njeopardize our ability to meet our growth targets or impact our results of operations.\nA failure to recruit, develop and retain effective leaders or the loss or shortage of personnel with key capacities and skills could impact our strategic\ndirection and jeopardize our ability to meet our business performance expectations and growth targets.\nOur future growth depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of key executives and other leadership team members. We must continue to\nrecruit, retain and motivate management team members in order to achieve our current business objectives and support our projected growth. Unplanned\nchanges in senior management could expose us to significant changes in strategic direction and initiatives. A failure to maintain appropriate organizational\ncapacity and capability to support leadership excellence (adequate resources, innovative skill sets and expectations) and build adequate bench strength required\nfor growth or a loss of key skill sets could jeopardize our ability to meet our business performance expectations and growth targets.\nWe may be subject to increased labor and insurance costs.\nOur restaurant operations are subject to United States and Canadian federal, state and local laws governing such matters as minimum wages, working\nconditions, overtime and tip credits. As federal, state and local minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum\nwage employees, but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage. Labor shortages, increased employee turnover and health\ncare and other benefit or working condition regulations also have increased and may continue to increase our labor costs. These increased costs could, in turn,\nlead us to increase our menu prices, which could negatively impact our sales. Conversely, if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting\nincreased labor costs by increases in menu prices, our profitability may decline. In addition, the current premiums that we pay for our insurance (including\nworkers\u2019 compensation, general liability, property, health, and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability) may increase at any time, thereby further increasing our costs.\nThe dollar amount of claims that we experience under our workers\u2019 compensation and general liability insurance, for which we carry high per-claim\ndeductibles, may also increase at any time, thereby further increasing our costs. Further, the decreased availability of property and liability insurance has the\npotential to negatively impact the cost of premiums and the magnitude of uninsured losses.\nRisks Relating to Health and Safety\nHealth concerns arising from food-related pandemics, outbreaks of flu, viruses or other diseases may have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe United States and other countries have experienced, or may experience in the future, outbreaks of viruses, such as the novel coronavirus that caused\nCOVID-19, norovirus, avian flu or \u201cSARS,\u201d \u201cMERS,\u201d H1N1 or \u201cswine flu,\u201d or other diseases. To the extent that a virus or disease is food-borne, or perceived\nto be food-borne, future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availability of certain food products and cause our guests to eat less of a product, or could\nreduce public confidence in food handling and/or public assembly. For example, public concern over avian flu may cause fear about the consumption of\nchicken, eggs and other products derived from poultry, and the inability to serve poultry-based products would restrict our ability to provide a variety of menu\nitems to our guests. If we change a restaurant menu in response to such concerns, we may lose guests who do not prefer the new menu, and we may not be able\nto attract a sufficient new guest base to produce the sales needed to make the restaurant profitable. We also may have different or additional competitors for our\nintended guests as a result of such a change and may not be able to successfully compete against such competitors. If a virus is transmitted by human contact or\nrespiratory transmission, our employees or guests could become infected, or could choose, or be advised, to avoid gathering in public places, any of which\ncould adversely affect our restaurant guest traffic and our ability to adequately staff our restaurants, receive deliveries on a timely basis or perform functions at\nthe corporate level. We also could be adversely affected if the World Health Organization and/or The United States Centers for Disease Control were to restrict\ntravel to affected geographic areas where we source our products, thus possibly impacting the continuity of supply. Additionally, jurisdictions in which we have\nrestaurants may impose mandatory closures, seek voluntary closures or impose restrictions on operations. Even if such measures are not implemented and a\nvirus or other disease does not spread significantly, the perceived risk of infection or significant health risk may cause guests to choose other alternatives to\ndining out in our restaurants which may adversely affect our business.\n16A failure to maintain food safety throughout the supply chain and food-borne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business.\nFood safety is a top priority for us, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensuring that our guests enjoy safe, quality food products.  Even with strong\npreventative interventions and controls, food safety issues could be caused at the source or by food suppliers or distributors and, as a result, may be out of our\ncontrol and require prompt action to mitigate impact.  In addition, regardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illnesses caused by pathogens\nsuch as E. coli, hepatitis A, norovirus, listeria or salmonella, or other food safety issues including food tampering or contamination at one of our restaurants\ncould adversely affect the reputation of our brands and have a negative impact on our sales. Even instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food\ncontamination occurring solely at our competitors\u2019 restaurants, suppliers or distributors (even if we do not work with them) could result in negative publicity\nabout the food service industry generally and adversely impact our sales. Social media has dramatically increased the speed with which negative publicity,\nincluding actual or perceived food safety incidents, is disseminated before there is any meaningful opportunity to investigate, respond to and address an issue.\nThe occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher\ncosts and lower margins.\nRisks Relating to Information Technology, Cybersecurity and Privacy\nWe rely heavily on information technology in our operations, and insufficient guest or employee facing technology or a failure to maintain a continuous\nand secure cyber network, free from material failure, interruption or security breach, could harm our ability to effectively operate our business and/or\nresult in the loss of respected relationships with our guests or employees.\nWe rely heavily on information systems across our operations, including for e-commerce, marketing programs, employee engagement, management of\nour supply chain, the point-of-sale processing system in our restaurants, and various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our\nbusiness and coordinate the production, distribution and sale of our products depends significantly on the reliability, security and capacity of these systems. In\naddition, we must effectively respond to changing guest expectations and new technological developments, and if we fail to implement emerging technologies\nas quickly and efficiently as our competitors, we may lose guests or employees. As technology continues to play an increasing role in our guests\u2019 experiences,\ndisruptions, failures or other performance issues with guest-facing technology systems could impair the benefits that they provide to our business and\nnegatively affect our relationship with our guests. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement\nsystems, or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure cyber network could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to the Company, our team\nmembers or guests. This could include the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or sensitive personal or financial information. Some of these essential\nbusiness processes that are dependent on technology are outsourced to third parties. While we make efforts to ensure that our providers are observing proper\nstandards and controls, we cannot guarantee that breaches or failures caused by these outsourced providers will not occur.\nFrom time to time, we and our third party service providers and suppliers experience unauthorized attempts to infiltrate and interrupt information systems.\nTo date, interruptions of these information systems as a result of unauthorized infiltration attempts have not had a material impact on our operations. However,\nbecause technology is increasingly complex and cyber-attacks are increasingly sophisticated and more frequent, there can be no assurance that such incidents\nwill not have a material adverse effect on us in the future. In addition, the rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may\nintensify our and our service providers\u2019 and key suppliers\u2019 cybersecurity risks. Unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises are becoming\nincreasingly sophisticated, more difficult to detect, contain and mitigate, and may occur through a variety of methods, including attacks using malicious code,\nvulnerabilities in software, hardware or other infrastructure (including systems used by our supply chain), system misconfigurations, phishing or social\nengineering. Failure of our or our service providers\u2019 information systems to function as intended, or cyber-attacks or security breaches, could result in loss of\nrevenue, assets, personal data, intellectual property, trade secrets or other sensitive and confidential data, violation of applicable privacy and data security laws,\nreputational harm to the companies and their brands, operational disruptions, legal challenges and significant remediation and other costs, all of which could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business.\nAny such failures or disruptions, whether caused by system failures or threat actors attempting to infiltrate our systems, may cause delays in guest\nservice, reduce efficiency in our operations, require significant capital investments to remediate the problem, result in customer, employee or advertiser\ndissatisfaction or otherwise result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation. We could also be subjected to litigation, regulatory investigations or the\nimposition of penalties. Such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy, cyber and other laws or trigger data\nbreach notification laws, including new disclosure rules promulgated by the SEC, and subject us to private third party or securities litigation and governmental\ninvestigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability. As information security laws and regulations\nchange and cyber risks evolve, we may be required to make significant capital\n17investments and other expenditures to comply with new legal requirements, investigate security incidents, remedy cybersecurity issues, recuperate lost data,\nprevent future compromises and adapt systems and practices to react to the changing threat environment.\nWe may incur increased costs to comply with privacy and data protection laws, and, if we fail to comply or our systems are compromised, we could be\nsubject to government enforcement actions, private litigation and adverse publicity.\nWe receive and maintain certain personal, financial and other information about our customers, employees, vendors and suppliers. In addition, certain of\nour vendors receive and maintain certain personal, financial and other information about our employees and customers. The use and handling, including\nsecurity, of this information is regulated by evolving and increasingly demanding data privacy laws and regulations in various jurisdictions, as well as by\ncertain third-party contracts and industry standards. Complying with existing and newly developed laws and regulations, which are subject to change and\nuncertain interpretations and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, may lead to a decline in guest engagement or cause us to incur substantial\ncosts or modifications to our operations or business practices to comply. The increasingly complex and evolving regulatory environment related to data privacy\nand data protection laws may result in significant costs arising from compliance and from any non-compliance, whether or not due to our negligence, and could\naffect our brand reputation and our results of operations. We have and expect to continue to have significant expenses arising from compliance with these\nregulatory regimes due to changes in the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and breaches. In addition, if our security and information\nsystems are compromised as a result of data corruption or loss, cyber-attack or a network security incident, or if our employees or vendors fail to comply with\nthese laws and regulations or fail to meet industry standards and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could result in\nliabilities and penalties and could damage our reputation, cause interruption of normal business performance, cause us to incur substantial costs and result in a\nloss of customer confidence, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we could be subject to litigation and\ngovernment enforcement actions as a result of any such failure.\nRisks Related to the Integration of Chuy\u2019s\nThe inability to successfully integrate the Chuy\u2019s brand\u2019s operations into our business could harm our ability to achieve the sales growth, cost savings and\nother benefits we expect to be able to realize from Chuy\u2019s operations.\nThe integration of the Chuy\u2019s business into our operations is a complex, costly and time-consuming process that may not be successful. The primary areas of\nfocus for successfully combining the business of Chuy\u2019s with our operations include, among others: retaining and integrating management and other key\nemployees; integrating information, communications and other systems; and managing the growth of the combined company.\nEven if we successfully integrate the business of Chuy\u2019s into our operations, there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits. We expect\nthat the acquisition of Chuy\u2019s will result in various benefits for the combined company including, among others, business and growth opportunities and\nsignificant synergies from increased efficiency in purchasing, distribution and other restaurant and corporate support. Increased competition and/or\ndeterioration in business conditions may limit or delay our ability to expand this business. As such, we may not be able to realize the synergies, goodwill,\nbusiness opportunities and growth prospects anticipated in connection with the acquisition of Chuy\u2019s.\nRisks Related to the Restaurant Industry\nWe are subject to a number of risks relating to public policy changes and federal, state and local regulation of our business, including in the areas of\nenvironmental matters, minimum wage, employee benefit regulations, unionization, menu labeling, immigration requirements and taxes, and an\ninsufficient or ineffective response to legislation or government regulation may adversely impact our cost structure, operational efficiencies and talent\navailability.\nThe restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws and regulations. The development and operation of restaurants\ndepends on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites to a significant extent, which are subject to building, zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other\nregulations and requirements. We are subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health, sanitation, safety and fire standards and\nthe sale of alcoholic beverages. We are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product\nsafety, nutritional content and menu labeling. We are subject to federal, state, and local laws governing employment practices and working conditions.   These\nlaws cover minimum wage rates, wage and hour practices, labor relations, paid and family leave, workplace safety, and immigration, among others.  The\nmyriad of laws and regulations being passed at the state and local level creates unique challenges for a multi-state employer as different standards apply to\ndifferent locations, sometimes with conflicting requirements.  We must continue to monitor and adapt our employment practices to comply with these various\nlaws and regulations. \n18We also are subject to federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities, such as the\nADA. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings, and a failure or\nperceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation. New or changing laws and regulations relating to\nunion organizing rights and activities may impact our operations at the restaurant level and increase our labor costs.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous\nmaterials. There also has been increasing focus by United States and overseas governmental authorities on other environmental matters, such as climate\nchange, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption. This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating a yet to be\nspecified array of environmental matters. Legislative, regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other environmental concerns could result in\nfuture increases in the cost of raw materials, taxes, compliance, risk management, transportation and utilities, which could decrease our operating profits and\nnecessitate future investments in facilities and equipment.\nWe are subject to laws relating to information security, cashless payments and consumer credit, protection and fraud. Compliance with these laws and\nregulations can be costly, and any failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws or any breach of our systems could harm our reputation or lead to\nlitigation, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences\nof litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or an insufficient or ineffective response to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could\nnegatively impact our cost structure, operational efficiencies and talent availability, and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Failure to\ncomply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses,\nadministrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our\nexposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.\nWe face intense competition, and if we have an insufficient strategy or focus on competition and the consumer landscape, our business, financial condition\nand results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe full-service dining sector of the restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to pricing, service, location, personnel, take-out and delivery\noptions and type and quality of food, and there are many well-established competitors. We compete within each market with national and regional restaurant\nchains and locally-owned restaurants. We also face growing competition as a result of the trend toward convergence in grocery, deli and restaurant services,\nparticularly in the supermarket industry which offers \u201cconvenient meals\u201d in the form of improved entr\u00e9es, side dishes or meal preparation kits from the deli or\nprepared foods sections. Furthermore, delivery aggregators and food delivery services provide consumers with convenient access to a broad range of competing\nrestaurant chains and food retailers, particularly in urbanized areas, and may form a closer relationship with our customers and increase costs to us. We\ncompete primarily on the quality, variety and value perception of menu items. The number and location of restaurants, type of brand, quality and efficiency of\nservice, attractiveness of facilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs are also important factors. We anticipate that intense competition\nwill continue with respect to all of these factors. We may be unable to successfully respond to changing consumer preferences, including with respect to new\ntechnologies and alternative methods of engaging with our brands, like delivery. In addition, online platforms and aggregators may direct potential customers to\nother options based on paid placements, online reviews or other factors. If we are unable to continue to compete effectively, our business, financial condition\nand results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to changes in consumer preferences that may adversely affect demand for food at our restaurants.\nConsumers are continually changing health and dietary preferences. As a result, our diverse portfolio of restaurant brands are continually challenged to\nevolve our menu offerings to appeal to these changing customer preferences, while maintaining our brand character and retaining popular menu items. During\nperiods of high public health risk such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, many consumers choose to order food To Go or for delivery rather than dining in at\nfull-service restaurants. If other future public health issues cause these preferences to increase, we may need to further adapt our offerings to respond to these\nadditional changes. New information or changes in dietary, nutritional, allergen or health guidelines or environmental or sustainability concerns, whether issued\nby government agencies, academic studies, advocacy organizations or similar groups, may cause some groups of consumers to select foods other than those\nthat are offered by our restaurants. If we fail to anticipate changing trends or other consumer preferences, our business, financial condition and results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\n19Our inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could have a material adverse impact on our\nbusiness.\nThe proliferation and utilization of existing and innovative social media platforms allows individuals and businesses access to a broad audience of\nconsumers and other interested persons. Many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post, often without\nfilters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. Information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate, each\nof which may harm our performance, prospects, or business.  The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.  The\ndissemination of information online could harm our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations, regardless of the information\u2019s accuracy.\n \nOur competitors are constantly expanding their use of social media and new social media platforms are rapidly being developed, potentially making more\ntraditional social media platforms obsolete. As a result, we need to continuously innovate and develop our social media strategies in order to maintain broad\nappeal with guests and brand relevance. As part of our marketing efforts, we rely on social media platforms and search engine marketing to attract and retain\nguests. We also continue to invest in other digital marketing initiatives that allow us to reach our guests across multiple digital channels and build their\nawareness of, engagement with, and loyalty to our brands. These initiatives may not be successful, resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher\nrevenues, increased employee engagement or brand recognition. In addition, a variety of risks are associated with the use of social media, including the\nimproper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about us, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud, or out-of-date information.\nThe inappropriate use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could\ndamage our reputation.\nA failure to identify and execute innovative marketing and guest relationship tactics, ineffective or improper use of other marketing initiatives, and\nincreased advertising and marketing costs could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.\nIf our competitors increase their spending on advertising and promotions, if our advertising, media or marketing expenses increase, if our advertising and\npromotions become less effective than those of our competitors, or if we do not adequately leverage technology and data analytic capabilities needed to\ngenerate concise competitive insight, we could experience a material adverse effect on our sales and our results of operations. A failure to sufficiently innovate,\ndevelop guest relationship initiatives, or maintain adequate and effective advertising could inhibit our ability to maintain brand relevance and drive increased\nsales.\nAs part of our marketing efforts, we rely on social media platforms and search engine marketing to attract and retain guests. These initiatives may not be\nsuccessful, and pose a variety of other risks, as discussed above under the heading: \u201cOur inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the\naccelerated impact of social media could have a material adverse impact on our business.\u201d\nClimate change, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters could adversely affect our sales or results of operations.\nThe long-term effects of climate change and global warming will result in more severe, volatile weather or extended droughts, which could increase the\nfrequency and duration of weather impacts on our operations. Adverse weather conditions have in the past and may continue to impact guest traffic at our\nrestaurants, cause the temporary underutilization of outdoor patio seating and, in more severe cases such as hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires or other natural\ndisasters, cause property damage and temporary closures, sometimes for prolonged periods, which could negatively impact our sales or costs. Climate change\nand government regulation relating to climate change, including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, could result in construction delays and increased\ncosts, interruptions to the availability or increases in the cost of utilities, and shortages or interruptions in the supply or increases to the costs of food items and\nother supplies.\nRisks Relating to Our Business Model and Strategy\nA majority of our restaurants are operated in leased properties and as a result, we are committed to long-term lease obligations that we may not be able to\ncancel if we want to close a restaurant location and we may be unable to renew the leases that we may want to extend at the end of their terms.\nAs of May 25, 2025, 2,065 of our 2,159 restaurants operating in the United States and Canada operate in leased locations, and the leases are generally\nnon-cancellable for some period of time. If we close a restaurant in a leased location, we may remain committed to perform our obligations under the\napplicable lease, which would include, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term. Additionally, the potential losses\nassociated with our inability to cancel leases may result in our keeping open restaurant locations that are performing significantly below targeted levels. As a\nresult, ongoing lease obligations at closed or underperforming restaurant locations could impair our results of operations. In addition, at the end of the lease\nterm and expiration of all renewal periods, we may be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost, if at all.\n20As a result, we may be required to close or relocate a restaurant, which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks that may have an adverse\neffect on our operating performance.\nOur inability or failure to execute on a comprehensive business continuity plan following a major natural disaster, such as a hurricane or manmade\ndisaster, at our corporate facility could have a materially adverse impact on our business.\nMany of our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are centralized at one Florida location. We have disaster\nrecovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature, including hurricanes and other natural or manmade\ndisasters, and back up and off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information. However, if we are unable to fully implement\nour disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and\ncompliance, failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and exposure to administrative and other legal claims.\nWe may lose sales or incur increased costs if our restaurants experience shortages, delays or interruptions in the delivery of food and other products from\nour third party vendors and suppliers.\nWe have a limited number of suppliers and distributors for certain of our products and services. Shortages, delays or interruptions in the supply of food\nitems and other supplies to our restaurants may be caused by severe weather; natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts, wildfires and\nearthquakes; macroeconomic conditions (such as tariffs and trade disputes) resulting in disruptions to the shipping and transportation industries; labor issues\nsuch as increased costs or worker shortages or other operational disruptions at our suppliers, vendors or other service providers; the inability of our vendors or\nservice providers to manage adverse business conditions, obtain credit or remain solvent; or other conditions beyond our control. Such shortages, delays or\ninterruptions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of the items we buy and the operations of our restaurants. Supply chain disruptions have\nincreased some of our costs and limited the availability of certain products for our restaurants in the past and may continue to do so. Consumers at our\nrestaurants may be sensitive to price increases, and if we increase menu prices as a result of increased food costs or remove menu items due to shortages, such\nresponses may negatively impact our sales. If we temporarily close a restaurant or remove popular items from a restaurant\u2019s menu, that restaurant may\nexperience a significant reduction in sales during the time affected by the shortage or thereafter as a result of our guests changing their dining habits.\nOur failure to drive both short-term and long-term profitable sales growth through brand relevance, operating excellence, opening new restaurants of\nexisting brands, and acquiring new restaurant brands could result in poor financial performance.\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to drive profitable sales growth by increasing same-restaurant sales at existing restaurants, continuing to\nexpand our current portfolio of restaurant brands, and acquiring additional brands that can be expanded profitably. This strategy involves numerous risks, and\nwe may not be able to achieve our growth objectives.\nAt existing brands, we may not be able to maintain brand relevance and restaurant operating excellence to achieve sustainable same-restaurant sales\ngrowth and warrant new unit growth. Failure to maintain such brand and operating excellence may also result in restaurant closures. Existing brand short-term\nsales growth could be impacted if we are unable to drive near-term guest count and sales growth, and long-term sales growth could be impacted if we fail to\nextend our existing brands in ways that are relevant to our guests. A failure to innovate and extend our existing brands in ways that are relevant to guests and\noccasions in order to generate sustainable same-restaurant traffic growth and produce non-traditional sales and earnings growth opportunities, insufficient focus\non our competition, or failure to adequately address declines in the casual dining industry, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition,\nwe may not be able to support sustained new unit growth or open all of our planned new restaurants, and the new restaurants that we open may not be\nprofitable or as profitable as our existing restaurants. New restaurants typically experience an adjustment period before sales levels and operating margins\nnormalize, and even sales at successful newly-opened restaurants generally do not make a significant contribution to profitability in their initial months of\noperation. The opening of new restaurants can also have an adverse effect on guest counts and sales levels at existing restaurants.\nThe ability to open and profitably operate restaurants is subject to various risks, such as the identification and availability of suitable and economically\nviable locations; the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations; the need to obtain all required governmental permits (including zoning\napprovals and liquor licenses) on a timely basis; the need to comply with other regulatory requirements; the availability of necessary contractors and\nsubcontractors; the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets; the ability to manage union activities such as picketing or hand billing which could\ndelay construction; increases in labor and building material costs; supply chain disruptions; the availability of financing at acceptable rates and terms; changes\nin patterns or severity of weather or other acts of God that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the\n21results of one or more restaurants for an indeterminate amount of time; and our ability to hire and train qualified management personnel and general economic\nand business conditions. At each potential location, we compete with other restaurants and retail businesses for desirable development sites, construction\ncontractors, management personnel, hourly employees and other resources. If we are unable to successfully manage these risks, we could face increased costs\nand lower than anticipated sales and earnings in future periods.\nWe also may not be able to identify and successfully acquire and integrate additional brands that are as profitable as our existing restaurants or that\nprovide potential for further growth.\nA lack of availability of suitable locations for new restaurants or a decline in the quality of the locations of our current restaurants may adversely affect our\nsales and results of operations.\nThe success of our restaurants depends in large part on their locations. As demographic and economic patterns change, current locations may not continue\nto be attractive or profitable. Possible declines in neighborhoods where our restaurants are located or adverse economic conditions in areas surrounding those\nneighborhoods could result in reduced sales in those locations. In addition, desirable locations for new restaurant openings or for the relocation of existing\nrestaurants may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new restaurant or relocation. The occurrence of one or\nmore of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nWe may experience higher-than-anticipated costs or delays associated with the opening of new restaurants or with the closing, relocating and remodeling\nof existing restaurants, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur sales and expenses can be impacted significantly by the number and timing of the opening of new restaurants and the closing, relocating and\nremodeling of existing restaurants. We incur substantial pre-opening expenses each time we open a new restaurant and other expenses when we close, relocate\nor remodel existing restaurants and we have experienced higher than usual costs and expenses in recent years. The expenses of opening, closing, relocating or\nremodeling any of our restaurants may be higher than anticipated. Increases in the time to procure or shortages of construction labor and materials and capital\nequipment, or permitting delays, may impact the time it takes to open new restaurants. An increase in such expenses or delays in the timeline to complete\nconstruction could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe face a variety of risks associated with doing business with franchisees and licensees.\nCertain of our domestic and all of our international locations other than in Canada are operated by franchisees or licensees. We believe that we have\nselected high-caliber operating partners and franchisees with significant experience in restaurant operations, and we are providing them with training and\nsupport. However, the probability of opening, ultimate success and quality of any franchise or licensed restaurant rests principally with the franchisee or\nlicensee. If the franchisee or licensee does not successfully open and operate its restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards, or guests have negative\nexperiences due to issues with food quality or operational execution, our brand values could suffer, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe face a variety of risks associated with doing business with business partners and vendors in foreign markets.\nWe are making efforts to expand our brands overseas through licensing and franchising relationships. There is no assurance that international operations\nwill be profitable or that international growth will continue. Our international operations are subject to all of the same risks associated with our domestic\noperations, as well as a number of additional risks. These include, among other things, international economic and political conditions, foreign currency\nfluctuations, trade disputes, potential increases in tariffs and differing cultures and consumer preferences. In addition, expansion into international markets\ncould create risks to our brands and reputation.\nWe also are subject to governmental regulations throughout the world that impact the way we do business with our international franchisees and vendors.\nThese include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, import/export/customs regulations and other international trade regulations, the USA\nPatriot Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and applicable local law. Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary\nliabilities and other sanctions, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nVolatility in the market value of derivatives we may use to hedge exposures to fluctuations in commodity and broader market prices may cause volatility in\nour gross margins and net earnings.\nWe use or may use derivatives to hedge price risk for some of our principal ingredient, labor and energy costs, including but not limited to coffee, butter,\nwheat, soybean oil, pork, beef, diesel fuel, gasoline and natural gas. Changes in the values of these derivatives may be recorded in earnings currently, resulting\nin volatility in both gross margin and net earnings. These gains and\n22losses are reported as a component of cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings included in our consolidated financial statements.\nVolatility in the United States equity markets affects our ability to efficiently hedge exposures to our market risk related to equity-based compensation\nawards.\nThe equity markets in the United States have experienced recent periods of volatility due to the impacts of macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical\nconcerns and the unpredictability of the impact on the United States economy as a result of these factors. Market volatility has contributed to and may continue\nto contribute to fluctuations in the Company\u2019s stock price. We have equity hedges in place to protect the Company from exposure to market risk related to\nfuture payout of equity-based compensation awards. However, because these hedges also net settle on a cash basis quarterly, we have been and may in the\nfuture be required to make cash payments at those quarterly settlement dates and the amounts of those payments are difficult to predict during periods of\nextreme volatility in the equity markets. These cash payments may ultimately be offset by payments to us from the hedge counterparties or reductions in\nexpected payouts to employees when those equity hedges finally fully settle and the related equity awards pay out.\nFailure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business.\nWe regard our Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen, Chuy\u2019s, Yard House, Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House, The Capital\nGrille, Seasons 52, Eddie V\u2019s Prime Seafood, Bahama Breeze, The Capital Burger , Dardenand Darden Restaurantsservice marks, and other service\nmarks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses, as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts. We rely on a combination\nof protections provided by contracts, copyrights, patents, trademarks, service marks and other common law rights, such as trade secret and unfair competition\nlaws, to protect our restaurants and services from infringement. We have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the United States and foreign\njurisdictions. However, we are aware of names and marks identical or similar to our service marks being used from time to time by other persons. Although our\npolicy is to oppose any such infringement, further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish\nthe value of our brands and adversely affect our business. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which\nwe have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant. Although we believe we have taken appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property, there can be\nno assurance that these protections will be adequate, and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the\nexpenditure of significant resources.\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) matters, our reporting of such matters, or sustainability ratings could negatively impact our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nESG related matters have received increased focus recently from investors, employees, ratings agencies, governmental agencies and other stakeholders.\nFrom time to time, we may publish statements relating to our commitment to responsible business, including commitments relating to greenhouse gas\nemissions. Such statements reflect the Company\u2019s current plans and aspirations at the time they are made, and should not be construed as guarantees or that we\nwill be able to achieve them. Our failure to adequately update, accomplish or accurately track and report on these commitments on a timely basis, or at all,\ncould adversely affect our reputation, financial performance and growth, and expose us to increased scrutiny from the investment community, special interest\ngroups and enforcement authorities. In addition, as an \u201canti-ESG\u201d sentiment exists among some individuals and government institutions, we may also face\nscrutiny, reputational risk, lawsuits or market access restrictions from these parties regarding our ESG initiatives. Additionally, we may face increased scrutiny\nrelated to any third party sustainability ratings we receive, which could adversely affect our reputation, business, and results of operations.\nGeneral Risks\nLitigation, including allegations of illegal, unfair or inconsistent employment practices, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results\nof operations.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, guests, suppliers, business partners, shareholders, government agencies or others through\nprivate actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. These actions and proceedings may involve allegations of\nillegal, unfair or inconsistent employment practices, including wage and hour violations and employment discrimination; guest discrimination; food safety\nissues including poor food quality, food-borne illness, food tampering, food contamination, and adverse health effects from consumption of various food\nproducts or high-calorie foods (including obesity); other personal injury; violation of \u201cdram shop\u201d laws (providing an injured party with recourse against an\nestablishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated party who then causes injury to himself or a third party); trademark infringement; violation of\nfederal securities laws; or other concerns. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify.\nPlaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very\u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \n23large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost\nto defend litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease guest acceptance of our brands,\nregardless of whether the allegations are valid or we ultimately are found liable. Litigation could impact our operations in other ways as well. Allegations of\nillegal, unfair or inconsistent employment practices, for example, could adversely affect employee acquisition and retention. As a result, litigation may\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnfavorable publicity, or a failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity, could harm our reputation and adversely impact our guest counts and sales.\nThe good reputation of our restaurant brands is a key factor in the success of our business. Actual or alleged incidents at any of our restaurants could\nresult in negative publicity that could harm our brands. Even incidents occurring at restaurants operated by our competitors or in the supply chain generally\ncould result in negative publicity that could harm the restaurant industry overall and, indirectly, our own brands. Negative publicity may result from allegations\nof illegal, unfair or inconsistent employment practices, employee dissatisfaction, guest discrimination, illness, injury, or any of the other matters discussed\nabove that could give rise to litigation. Reputational value is also based on perceptions, and broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide\npublic feedback that can influence perceptions of us, our brands, and our properties, and it may be difficult to control or effectively manage negative publicity,\nregardless of whether it is accurate. While reputations may take decades to build, negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence, particularly if they\nresult in adverse mainstream and social media publicity, governmental investigations, proceedings or penalties, or litigation. Regardless of whether the\nallegations or complaints are valid, unfavorable publicity relating to a limited number of our restaurants, or to only a single restaurant, could adversely affect\npublic perception of the entire brand. Negative publicity, including through social media, also may result from health concerns including food safety and flu or\nvirus outbreaks, publication of government or industry findings concerning food products, environmental disasters, crime incidents, data security breaches,\nscandals involving our employees, or operational problems at our restaurants, all of which could make our brands and menu offerings less appealing to our\nguests and negatively impact our guest counts and sales. Adverse publicity and its effect on overall consumer perceptions of our brands, or our failure to\nrespond effectively to adverse publicity, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDisruptions in the financial and credit markets may adversely impact consumer spending patterns and affect the availability and cost of credit.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial\npurposes will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and\nother factors beyond our control. Turmoil in global credit markets could adversely impact the availability of credit already arranged, and the availability and\ncost of credit in the future. There can be no assurances that we will be able to arrange credit on terms we believe are acceptable or that permit us to finance our\nbusiness with historical margins. A lack of credit could have an adverse impact on certain of our suppliers, landlords and other tenants in retail centers in which\nwe are located. If these issues occur, they could negatively affect our financial results. Any new disruptions in the financial markets may also adversely affect\nthe U.S. and world economy, which could negatively impact consumer spending patterns.\nImpairment of the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nGoodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired companies and the related fair values of net assets acquired. A significant\namount of judgment is involved in determining if an indication of impairment of goodwill exists. Factors may include, among others: a significant decline in\nour expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in\nthe business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and slower growth rates. Any\nadverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and negatively affect our financial condition and results of\noperations. We compute the amount of impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of that reporting unit. We are\nrequired to record a non-cash impairment charge if the testing performed indicates that goodwill has been impaired.\nWe evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets, primarily the LongHorn Steakhouse, Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen,The Capital Grille, Ruth\u2019s\nChris Steak House, Yard Houseand Eddie V\u2019s Prime Seafood trademarks, to determine if they are definite or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on\nuseful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as\nthe stability of the industry, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels),\nthe level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.\u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n24As with goodwill, we test our indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily trademarks) for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairments of these or\nother assets. Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of\noperations.\nChanges in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are primarily subject to income and other taxes in the United States. Our effective income tax rate and other taxes in the future could be adversely\naffected by a number of factors, including changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or other legislative changes and the\noutcome of income tax or other tax audits. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits could be materially\ndifferent from our historical tax accruals and income tax provisions. The results of a tax audit could have a material effect on our results of operations or cash\nflows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. In addition, our effective income tax rate and our results may be impacted by our ability to\nrealize deferred tax benefits and by any increases or decreases of our valuation allowances applied to our existing deferred tax assets.\nFailure of our internal controls over financial reporting and future changes in accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected operating results,\naffect our reported results of operations or otherwise harm our business and financial results.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial\nreporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide\nabsolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud. Our growth and acquisition of other restaurant\ncompanies with procedures not identical to our own could place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting. Any\nfailure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or\nto detect and prevent fraud. A significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of\ninvestor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock, increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage\nour reputation.\nA change in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions before the change is\neffective. New pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing accounting\nrules or the application of current accounting practices may adversely affect our reported financial results. Additionally, our assumptions, estimates and\njudgments related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results. Generally accepted accounting principles and related\naccounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including\nbut not limited to, revenue recognition, fair value of investments, impairment of long-lived assets, leases and related economic transactions, derivatives,\npension and post-retirement benefits, intangibles, self-insurance, income taxes, property and equipment, unclaimed property laws and litigation, and stock-\nbased compensation are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by us. Changes in these rules or their interpretation\nor changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by us could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance.\nItem 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe have implemented policies and procedures intended to manage and reduce cybersecurity risk that are integrated with the Enterprise Risk\nManagement (\u201cERM\u201d) framework utilized by management and the Audit Committee to oversee our various top enterprise risks. We maintain an incident\nresponse plan that is designed to protect against, identify, evaluate, respond to and recover from a cybersecurity related incident. The plan provides for the\ncreation of an incident response team in the event of an incident and it is designed to be flexible enough to accommodate a broad array of potential scenarios.\nThe incident response team is a cross-functional group that may be composed of both Company personnel and external service providers, and that is tailored to\na particular incident so that individuals with appropriate experience and expertise are available. We conduct regular exercises to help ensure the plan\u2019s\neffectiveness and our overall response preparedness.\n25We have also invested in various tools to protect our data and information technology. We maintain a robust system of data protection and\ncybersecurity resources, technology and processes, and we regularly evaluate new and emerging risks and ever-changing legal and compliance requirements.\nWe make ongoing strategic investments to address these risks, including maintaining insurance coverage to mitigate the potential financial consequences of\ncybersecurity incidents, and compliance requirements and help keep Company, guest and team member data secure. We monitor risks of sensitive information\ncompromise at our business partners, where relevant, and reevaluate these risks on a periodic basis. In addition, we have a cybersecurity training program\ndesigned to educate and train employees how to identify and report cybersecurity threats. Training programs are conducted on a periodic basis and are focused\non giving employees the awareness and tools to manage the most relevant and prevalent cybersecurity risks to us. We also provide specialized training for\nemployees in more sensitive roles. For example, we perform annual and ongoing cybersecurity awareness training for our restaurant management and\nrestaurant support center team members. In addition, we provide annual credit card handling training following Payment Card Industry (PCI) guidelines to all\nteam members that handle guest credit cards. We conduct regular drills, such as tabletop exercises led by third party consultants, to support our overall\npreparedness for a variety of scenarios.\nWe take measures to regularly update and improve our cybersecurity program, including conducting independent program assessments, penetration\ntesting and scanning of our systems for vulnerabilities. We periodically engage third parties to perform cybersecurity audits to measure the maturity of our\ncybersecurity program against the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Framework. We also engage third parties to conduct security reviews\nof our network, processes and systems on a regular basis to identify opportunities and enhancements to strengthen our policies and practices.\nWith respect to third-party service providers, our information security program includes conducting due diligence of relevant service providers\u2019\ninformation security programs prior to onboarding and we continue to reassess vendors using a risk-based approach. We also contractually require third-party\nservice providers with access to our information technology systems, sensitive business data or personal information to implement and maintain appropriate\nsecurity controls and contractually restrict their ability to use our data, including personal information, for purposes other than to provide services to us, except\nas required by law. To oversee the risks associated with these service providers, we work with them to help ensure that their cybersecurity protocols are\nappropriate to the risk presented by their access to or use of our systems and/or data, including notification and coordination concerning incidents occurring on\nthird-party systems that may affect us. Our service providers are contractually required to notify us promptly of information security incidents occurring on\ntheir systems that may affect our systems or data, including personal information.\nAlthough we have invested in the protection of our data and information technology and monitor our systems on an ongoing basis, there can be no\nassurance that such efforts will prevent material compromises to our information technology systems in the future that could have a material adverse effect on\nour business. As of the date of this filing, we are not aware of any current cybersecurity threats or incidents that have materially affected or are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. For further discussion of the risks related to cybersecurity, see the risk\nfactors discussed under \u201cRisks Relating to Information Technology, Cybersecurity and Privacy\u201d in our Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nGovernance\nOur Board of Directors has ultimate risk oversight responsibility for the Company and administers this responsibility both directly and with assistance\nfrom its committees. Each of the committees periodically reports to the Board of Directors on its specific risk oversight activities. The Audit Committee,\ncomprised solely of independent directors, oversees our overall ERM program and assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibility with\nrespect to our information security and technology risks (including cybersecurity), all of which are fully integrated into our ERM program. The Audit\nCommittee actively reviews and discusses our information security and technology risk management programs and regularly reports out to the full Board of\nDirectors on our relevant strengths and opportunities.\nOur cybersecurity program is led by our Chief Information Officer (CIO), who is responsible for identifying, assessing and managing our collective\ninformation security and technology risks. Our current CIO has served in that role since 2016 and has more than 20 years of experience in the information\nsecurity and technology fields. Our CIO holds both bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in Electrical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nThe CIO meets regularly with leaders of our various information technology management teams to review and discuss our cybersecurity and other\ninformation technology risks and opportunities. Our global incident response plan sets forth a detailed security incident management and reporting protocol,\nwith escalation timelines and responsibilities.\n26The Audit Committee receives periodic updates from the CIO, the director of our cybersecurity team and a senior attorney, the three most senior\nleaders with responsibility for oversight of our key cybersecurity program components. These updates include matters such as ongoing changes in our external\nand internal cybersecurity threat landscape, new technology trends and regulatory developments, evolving internal policies and practices used to manage and\nmitigate cybersecurity and technology-related risks, and trends in various metrics that are used to help assess our overall cybersecurity program effectiveness.\nOur CIO also provides updates to the full Board of Directors on such topics at least annually.\nItem 2.PROPERTIES\nRestaurant Properties \u2013 Continuing Operations\nAs of May 25, 2025, we owned and operated 2,159 restaurants. Our company-owned restaurants are located in all 50 of the United States, Washington\nD.C. and Canada. Of the company-owned restaurants, 94 were located on owned sites and 2,065 were located on leased sites. The leases are classified as\nfollows:\nLand-Only Leases (we own buildings and equipment) 1,102 \nGround and Building Leases 666 \nSpace/In-Line/Other Leases 297 \nTotal 2,065 \nWe also lease our Restaurant Support Center which is located in Orlando, Florida.\nItem 3.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nSee the discussion of legal proceedings contained in the third paragraph of Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of\nthis report).\nItem 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\n27PART II\nItem 5.MARKET FOR REGISTRANT\u2019S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF\nEQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket and Dividend Information\nThe principal United States market on which our common shares are traded is the New York Stock Exchange, where our shares are traded under the\nsymbol DRI. As of June 30, 2025, there were approximately 7,400 holders of record of our common shares. The number of registered holders does not include\nholders who are beneficial owners but whose shares are held in street name by brokers and other nominees.\nWe have not sold any equity securities during the last fiscal year that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nWe have a history of paying cash dividends. Any future dividend payments remain subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors.\nShare Repurchases\nSince commencing our common share repurchase program in December 1995, we have repurchased a total of 213.3 million shares through May 25, 2025\nunder authorizations from our Board of Directors. The table below provides information concerning our repurchase of shares of our common stock during the\nquarter ended May 25, 2025:\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data)Total Number\nof Shares Purchased\n(1) (2)Average\nPrice Paid\nper ShareTotal Number of\nShares Purchased as\nPart of Publicly\nAnnounced Plans or\nProgramsMaximum Dollar Value of\nShares That\nMay Yet Be\nPurchased Under the\nPlans or Programs (3)\nFebruary 24, 2025 through March 30, 2025 157,368 $193.77 157,368 $517.7\nMarch 31, 2025 through Apri1 27, 2025 53,445 $196.72 53,445 $507.2\nApril 28, 2025 through May 25, 2025 49,251 $203.32 49,251 $497.2\nQuarter-to-Date 260,064 $196.19 260,064 $497.2\n(1)All of the shares purchased during the quarter ended May 25, 2025 were purchased as part of our repurchase program. On June 18, 2025, Darden's Board\nof Directors authorized a new share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to $1 billion of its outstanding common stock.

(Darden, the Company, we, us or our) should be read in conjunction with our\nconsolidated financial statements and related financial statement notes included in Part II of this report under the caption \u201cItem 8 - Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data.\u201d We operate on a 52/53-week fiscal year, which ends on the last Sunday in May. Fiscal 2025, which ended May 25, 2025, and fiscal 2024,\nwhich ended May 26, 2024, each consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal 2026, which ends on May 31, 2026, will consist of 53 weeks.\nOVERVIEW OF OPERATIONS\nOur business operates in the full-service dining segment of the restaurant industry. At May 25, 2025, we owned and operated 2,159 restaurants through\nsubsidiaries in the United States and Canada under the Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen, Chuy\u2019s, Yard House, Ruth\u2019s\nChris Steak House(Ruth\u2019s Chris), The Capital Grille, Seasons 52, Eddie V\u2019s Prime Seafood (Eddie V\u2019s), Bahama Breeze and The Capital Burger\ntrademarks. We own and operate all of our restaurants in the United States and Canada, except for 5 restaurants we manage through joint venture or other\ncontractual agreements and 85 franchised restaurants. We also have 69 franchised restaurants in operation located in Canada, Latin America, the Caribbean,\nAsia and the Middle East. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nOn October 11, 2024, we acquired 100 percent of the equity interest of Chuy\u2019s Holdings Inc. (Chuy\u2019s) in an all-cash transaction of $649.1 million in total\nconsideration, $613.7 million in net cash consideration, inclusive of $35.4 million of cash on Chuy\u2019s balance sheet at closing. As a result of the acquisition and\nrelated integration efforts, we incurred expenses of $44.6 million ($36.7 million, net of tax) during the twelve months ended May 25, 2025.\nFiscal 2025 Financial Highlights\n\u2022Total sales increased 6.0 percent to $12.08 billion in fiscal 2025 from $11.39 billion in fiscal 2024 driven by a blended same-restaurant sales increase\nof 2.0 percent and sales from the addition of 103 net company-owned Chuy\u2019s restaurants and 25 other net new restaurants.\n\u2022Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased to $8.88 in fiscal 2025 from $8.53 in fiscal 2024, a 4.1 percent increase.\n\u2022Net earnings from continuing operations increased to $1.05 billion in fiscal 2025 from $1.03 billion in fiscal 2024, a 2.0 percent increase.\n\u2022Net loss from discontinued operations decreased to $1.4 million ($0.02 per diluted share) in fiscal 2025, from $2.9 million ($0.02 per diluted share)\nin fiscal 2024. When combined with results from continuing operations, our diluted net earnings per share was $8.86 for fiscal 2025 and $8.51 for\nfiscal 2024.\nOutlook\nWe expect fiscal 2026 sales from continuing operations to increase between 7.0 to 8.0 percent, driven by growth of 2.0 percent related to the fifty-third\nweek in fiscal 2026, same-restaurant sales growth of 2.0 to 3.5 percent, and sales from 60 to 65 new restaurant openings. In fiscal 2026, we expect our annual\neffective tax rate to be 13 percent, and we expect capital expenditures incurred to build new restaurants, remodel and maintain existing restaurants and\ntechnology initiatives to be between $700 million and $750 million.\n(1) Annual same-restaurant sales is a 52-week metric and excludes the impact of Chuy\u2019s, which will not have been owned and operated by Darden for a 16-\nmonth period prior to the beginning of fiscal 2026, as well as any additional locations not expected to be operated by Darden for the entirety of the fiscal year.\u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n (1)\n30RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 2025 AND 2024\nTo facilitate review of our results of operations, the following table sets forth our financial results for the periods indicated.

The increase in same-restaurant sales in fiscal 2025 resulted from a 3.1 percent increase in average check and a 1.9 percent increase in same-\nrestaurant guest counts.\nFine Dining\u2019s sales increase for fiscal 2025 was driven by revenue from new restaurants offset by same-restaurant sales decreases. The decrease in same-\nrestaurant sales in fiscal 2025 resulted from a 5.2 percent decrease in same-restaurant guest counts offset by a 2.3 percent increase in average check.\nOther Business\u2019s sales increase for fiscal 2025 was driven by a U.S. same-restaurant sales increase combined with revenue from new restaurants\nincluding the acquisition of Chuy\u2019s. The increase in same-restaurant sales in fiscal 2025 resulted from a 2.6 percent increase in average check offset by a 2.4\npercent decrease in same-restaurant guest counts.\n32COSTS AND EXPENSES\nThe following table sets forth selected operating data as a percent of sales from continuing operations for the periods indicated. This information is\nderived from the consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal years ended May 25, 2025 and May 26, 2024.\nFiscal Year Ended\nMay 25, 2025 May 26, 2024\nSales 100.0 % 100.0 %\nCosts and expenses:\nFood and beverage 30.3 30.9 \nRestaurant labor 31.7 31.8 \nRestaurant expenses 16.1 15.9 \nMarketing expenses 1.4 1.3 \nPre-opening costs 0.2 0.2 \nGeneral and administrative expenses 4.3 4.2 \nDepreciation and amortization 4.3 4.0 \nImpairments and disposal of assets, net 0.4 0.1 \nTotal operating costs and expenses 88.7 % 88.5 %\nOperating income 11.3 % 11.5 %\nInterest, net 1.4 1.2 \nEarnings before income taxes 9.8 % 10.3 %\nIncome tax expense 1.1 1.3 \nEarnings from continuing operations 8.7 % 9.0 %\nTotal operating costs and expenses from continuing operations were $10.71 billion in fiscal 2025 and $10.08 billion in fiscal 2024.\nFiscal 2025 Compared to Fiscal 2024:\n\u2022Food and beverage costs decreased as a percent of sales primarily due to a 0.9 percent impact from pricing leverage and a 0.2 percent impact from cost\nsavings, partially offset by a 0.3 percent impact from mix and other and a 0.2 percent impact from inflation.\n\u2022Restaurant labor costs decreased as a percent of sales primarily due to a 0.8 percent impact from sales leverage, a 0.2 percent impact from productivity\nimprovement and a 0.2 percent impact from lower benefits expense, partially offset by a 1.1 percent impact from inflation.\n\u2022Restaurant expenses increased as a percent of sales primarily due to a 0.5 percent impact from inflation, a 0.2 percent impact from brand mix,\nincluding Chuy\u2019s and a 0.1 percent impact from Uber Direct fees, partially offset by a 0.4 percent impact from sales leverage and a 0.2 percent impact\nfrom other expenses.\n\u2022Marketing expenses increased as a percent of sales primarily due to increased marketing and media.\n\u2022Pre-opening costs remained flat as a percent of sales.\n\u2022General and administrative expenses increased as a percent of sales primarily due to a 0.4 percent impact from Chuy\u2019s acquisition and integration\ncosts, 0.1 percent impact from inflation, a 0.1 percent impact from mark to market adjustments and a 0.1 percent impact from restaurant closures,\npartially offset by a 0.4 percent impact from reduced Ruth\u2019s Chris acquisition and integration costs and by a 0.2 percent impact from sales leverage.\n\u2022Depreciation and amortization expenses increased as a percent of sales primarily due to the acquisition of Chuy\u2019s as well as incremental depreciation\non brand assets.\n\u2022Impairments and disposal of assets, net increased as a percent of sales primarily due to the decision to close twenty-two underperforming restaurant\nlocations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe effective income tax rates for fiscal 2025 and 2024 for continuing operations were 11.5 percent and 12.3 percent, respectively. During fiscal 2025, we\nhad income tax expense of $136.2 million on earnings before income tax of $1.19 billion\n33compared to income tax expense of $145.0 million on earnings before income taxes of $1.18 billion in fiscal 2024. This change was primarily driven by federal\ntax credits.\nH.R. 1., also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), was enacted on July 4, 2025. The legislation includes several provisions that may\nimpact the timing and magnitude of certain tax deductions. Key provisions include the permanent extension of several business tax benefits originally\nintroduced under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We are currently evaluating the provisions of the OBBBA to assess their potential impact on our financial\nposition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNET EARNINGS AND NET EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\nNet earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2025 were $1.05 billion ($8.88 per diluted share) compared with net earnings from continuing\noperations for fiscal 2024 of $1.03 billion ($8.53 per diluted share).\nNet earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2025 increased 2.0 percent and diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations increased 4.1\npercent compared with fiscal 2024.\nLOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nOn an after-tax basis, results from discontinued operations for fiscal 2025 were a net loss of $1.4 million ($0.02 per diluted share) compared with a net\nloss for fiscal 2024 of $2.9 million ($0.02 per diluted share).\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nWe manage our restaurant brands, Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen, Chuy\u2019s, Yard House, Ruth\u2019s Chris, The Capital\nGrille, Seasons 52, Eddie V\u2019s, Bahama Breeze and The Capital Burger in the U.S. and Canada as operating segments. We aggregate our operating segments\ninto reportable segments based on a combination of the size, economic characteristics and sub-segment of full-service dining within which each brand operates.\nOur four reportable segments are: (1) Olive Garden, (2) LongHorn Steakhouse, (3) Fine Dining and (4) Other Business. See Note 6 of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this report) for further details.\nOur management uses segment profit as the measure for assessing performance of our segments. The following table presents segment profit margin for\nthe periods indicated:\nFiscal Year Ended Change\nSegment May 25, 2025 May 26, 2024 2025 vs 2024\nOlive Garden 22.3% 22.1% 20 BP\nLongHorn Steakhouse 19.3% 18.4% 90 BP\nFine Dining 18.6% 19.0% (40)BP\nOther Business 15.7% 15.3% 40 BP\nThe increases in the Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse segment profit margins for fiscal 2025 were both driven primarily by positive same-\nrestaurant sales and lower food and beverage costs, partially offset by higher restaurant expenses and marketing costs. The decrease in the Fine Dining segment\nprofit margin for fiscal 2025 was driven primarily by negative same-restaurant sales and higher restaurant labor and restaurant expenses, partially offset by\nlower food and beverage costs. The increase in the Other Business segment profit margin for fiscal 2025 was driven primarily by positive same-restaurant sales\nand lower food and beverage costs, partially offset by increased restaurant expenses and marketing costs.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 2024 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2023\nFor a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended May 26, 2024 and May 28, 2023, see \u201cPart II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 26, 2024, filed with the SEC\non July 19, 2024.\nSEASONALITY\nOur sales volumes have historically fluctuated seasonally. Our average sales per restaurant are highest in the winter and spring, followed by the fall and\nsummer. Holidays, changes in the economy, severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions. Because of\nthe historical seasonality of our business and these other factors, results for any fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved\nfor the full fiscal year.\n34IMPACT OF INFLATION\nWe attempt to minimize the annual effects of inflation through appropriate planning, operating practices and menu price increases. We recently operated\nin a period of higher than usual inflation, led by food and beverage cost and labor inflation. Food and beverage inflation is principally due to increased costs\nincurred by our vendors related to higher labor, transportation, packaging, and raw materials costs. Some of the impacts of inflation have been offset by menu\nprice increases and other adjustments made during the year. Whether we are able and/or choose to continue to offset the effects of inflation will determine to\nwhat extent, if any, inflation affects our restaurant profitability in future periods.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial\nstatements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from\nthose estimates.\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this report).\nJudgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or\nusing different assumptions. We consider the following estimates to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nLeases\nWe evaluate our leases at their inception to estimate their expected term, which commences on the date when we have the right to control the use of the\nleased property and includes the non-cancelable base term plus all option periods we are reasonably certain to exercise. Our judgment in determining the\nappropriate expected term and discount rate for each lease affects our evaluation of:\n\u2022The classification and accounting for leases as operating versus finance;\n\u2022The rent holidays and escalation in payments that are included in the calculation of the lease liability and related right-of-use asset; and\n\u2022The term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant facility are amortized.\nThese judgments may produce materially different amounts of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognized on our consolidated balance sheets, as\nwell as depreciation, amortization, interest and rent expense recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings if different discount rates and expected lease\nterms were used.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets\nLand, buildings and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and certain other assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for\nimpairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. A significant amount of\njudgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in our\nexpected future cash flows; changes in expected useful life; unanticipated competition; slower growth rates, ongoing maintenance and improvements of the\nassets, or changes in the usage or operating performance. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these\nassets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Based on a review of operating results for each of our restaurants, given the\ncurrent operating environment, the amount of net book value associated with lower performing restaurants that would be deemed at risk for impairment is not\nmaterial to our consolidated financial statements.\nValuation and Recoverability of Goodwill and Trademarks\nWe have eleven reporting units, eight of which have goodwill and nine of which have trademarks. Goodwill and trademarks are not subject to\namortization and have been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing. The reporting units are our restaurant brands. A significant amount\nof judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in our\nexpected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the\nbusiness climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and slower growth rates. Any\nadverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated\nfinancial statements. We review our goodwill and trademarks for impairment annually, as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter, or more frequently if\nindicators of impairment exist.\n35During fiscal 2025, we elected to perform a qualitative assessment for our annual review of goodwill and trademarks to determine whether or not\nindicators of impairment exist. In considering the qualitative approach related to goodwill, we evaluated factors including, but not limited to, macro-economic\nconditions, market and industry conditions, commodity cost fluctuations, competitive environment, share price performance, results of prior impairment tests,\noperational stability, the overall financial performance of the reporting units and the impacts of discount rates. As it relates to trademarks, we evaluate similar\nfactors from the goodwill assessment, in addition to impacts of royalty rates. As a result of the qualitative assessment, no indicators of impairment were\nidentified, and no additional indicators of impairment were identified through the end of our fourth fiscal quarter that would require us to test further for\nimpairment.\nWe evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets to determine if they are definite or indefinite-lived. A determination on useful life requires\nsignificant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the\nindustry, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required\nmaintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.\nUnearned Revenues\nUnearned revenues primarily represent our liability for gift cards that have been sold but not yet redeemed. The estimated value of gift cards expected to\nremain unused is recognized over the expected period of redemption as the remaining gift card values are redeemed, generally over a period of 12 years.\nUtilizing this method, we estimate both the amount of breakage and the time period of redemption. If actual redemption patterns vary from our estimates,\nactual gift card breakage income may differ from the amounts recorded. We update our estimates of our redemption period and our breakage rate periodically\nand apply that rate to gift card redemptions on a prospective basis. Changing our breakage-rate estimates by 50 basis points would have resulted in an\nadjustment in our breakage income of approximately $3.5 million for fiscal 2025.\nIncome Taxes\nWe estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes. These estimates include, among other items, depreciation and amortization expense\nallowable for tax purposes, allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported employee tip income, effective rates for state and local income taxes\nand the tax deductibility of certain other items. We adjust our annual effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes\navailable.\nAssessment of uncertain tax positions requires judgments relating to the amounts, timing and likelihood of resolution. As described in Note 13 of the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this report), the $21.4 million balance of unrecognized tax benefits at May 25, 2025, includes\n$1.3 million related to tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts could change during the next 12 months based on the outcome of\nexaminations. All of such $1.3 million relates to items that would impact our effective income tax rate.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nTypically, cash flows generated from operating activities are our principal source of liquidity, which we use to finance capital expenditures for new\nrestaurants and to remodel and maintain existing restaurants, to pay dividends to our shareholders and to repurchase shares of our common stock. Since\nsubstantially all of our sales are for cash and cash equivalents, and accounts payable are generally paid in 5 to 90 days, we are typically able to carry current\nliabilities in excess of current assets.\nWe currently manage our business and financial ratios to target an investment-grade bond rating, which has historically allowed flexible access to\nfinancing at reasonable costs. Our publicly issued long-term debt currently carries the following ratings:\n\u2022Moody\u2019s Investors Service \u201cBaa2\u201d;\n\u2022Standard & Poor\u2019s \u201cBBB\u201d; and\n\u2022Fitch \u201cBBB\u201d.\nOur commercial paper has ratings of:\n\u2022Moody\u2019s Investors Service \u201cP-2\u201d;\n\u2022Standard & Poor\u2019s \u201cA-2\u201d; and\n\u2022Fitch \u201cF-2\u201d.\nThese ratings are as of the date of the filing of this report and have been obtained with the understanding that Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Standard &\nPoor\u2019s and Fitch will continue to monitor our credit and make future adjustments to these ratings to the extent warranted. The ratings are not a recommendation\nto buy, sell or hold our securities, may be changed, superseded or withdrawn at any time and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\n36On October 23, 2023, we entered into a $1.25 billion Revolving Credit Agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A. (BOA), as\nadministrative agent, and the lenders and other agents party thereto. The Revolving Credit Agreement is a senior unsecured credit commitment to the Company\nand contains customary representations and affirmative and negative covenants (including limitations on liens and subsidiary debt and a maximum\nconsolidated lease adjusted total debt to total capitalization ratio of 0.75 to 1.00) and events of default usual for credit facilities of this type. As of May 25,\n2025, we had no outstanding balances and were in compliance with all covenants under the Revolving Credit Agreement. As of May 25, 2025, $0.2 million of\nletters of credit were outstanding, which was backed by this facility. After consideration of letters of credit backed by the Revolving Credit Agreement, as of\nMay 25, 2025, we had $1.25 billion of credit available under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nLoans under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate of (a) Term SOFR (which is defined, for the applicable interest period, as the Term\nSOFR Screen Rate two U.S. Government Securities Business Days prior to the commencement of such interest period with a term equivalent to such interest\nperiod) plus a Term SOFR adjustment of 0.10 percent plus the relevant margin determined by reference to a ratings-based pricing grid (Applicable Margin), or\n(b) the base rate (which is defined as the highest of the BOA prime rate, the Federal Funds rate plus 0.500 percent, and the Term SOFR plus 1.00 percent) plus\nthe relevant Applicable Margin. Assuming a \u201cBBB\u201d equivalent credit rating level, the Applicable Margin under the Revolving Credit Agreement is 1.000\npercent for Term SOFR loans and 0.000 percent for base rate loans.\nOn September 16, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 1 (Amendment) to the Revolving Credit Agreement, which replaced the prior financial\ncovenant (which provided for a maximum consolidated total debt to total capitalization ratio) with a new financial covenant requiring us to maintain, measured\nas of the end of each fiscal quarter, a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 (which may be temporarily increased to 4.00 to 1.00 upon the\nelection as a result of a covered acquisition, subject to customary limitations set forth in the Revolving Credit Agreement). All other material terms and\nconditions of the Revolving Credit Agreement were unchanged.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement matures on October 23, 2028, and the proceeds may be used for working capital and capital expenditures, the\nrefinancing of certain indebtedness, certain acquisitions and general corporate purposes.\nOn September 16, 2024, we entered into a senior unsecured $600 million 2-year Term Loan Credit Agreement (Term Loan Agreement) with BOA, as\nadministrative agent, the lenders and other agents party thereto, the material terms of which were consistent with the Revolving Credit Agreement. The\nintended use of the proceeds was to finance our acquisition of Chuy\u2019s and we subsequently terminated the Term Loan Agreement on October 3, 2024, in\nconnection with the closing of our senior notes issuance discussed below. We did not draw any funds, and there were never any outstanding borrowings under\nthe Term Loan Agreement.\nOn October 3, 2024, we issued and sold $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.350 percent Senior Notes due 2027 (2027 Notes) and $350.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount of 4.550 percent Senior Notes due 2029 (2029 Notes and, together with the 2027 Notes, the Notes), pursuant to the\nprovisions of the Underwriting Agreement, dated September 30, 2024, among the Company and BofA Securities, Inc., Truist Securities, Inc., U.S. Bancorp\nInvestments, Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein. The Notes were issued under the Company\u2019s\nIndenture, dated as of January 1, 1996, between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, National Association (as successor to Wells Fargo Bank,\nNational Association, successor to Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, National Association, formerly known as Norwest Bank Minnesota, National Association), as\ntrustee (Base Trustee), as amended and supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of October 4, 2023, among the Company, the Base\nTrustee and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as a successor trustee with respect to the Notes. We used the proceeds from our issuance of the\nNotes to finance our acquisition of Chuy\u2019s and for general corporate purposes.\nThe 2027 Notes will mature on October 15, 2027, and the 2029 Notes will mature on October 15, 2029. Interest on the Notes will be paid semi-annually\nin arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on April 15, 2025, to holders of record on the preceding March 31 or September 30, as the\ncase may be.\n37As of May 25, 2025, our outstanding long-term debt consisted principally of:\n\u2022$500.0 million of unsecured 3.850 percent senior notes due in May 2027;\n\u2022$400.0 million of unsecured 4.350 percent senior notes due in October 2027;\n\u2022$350.0 millions of unsecured 4.550 percent senior notes due in October 2029;\n\u2022$500.0 million of unsecured 6.300 percent senior notes due October 2033;\n\u2022$96.3 million of unsecured 6.000 percent senior notes due in August 2035;\n\u2022$42.8 million of unsecured 6.800 percent senior notes due in October 2037; and\n\u2022$300.0 million of unsecured 4.550 percent senior notes due in February 2048.\nThe interest rate on our $42.8 million 6.800 percent senior notes due October 2037 is subject to adjustment from time to time if the debt rating assigned to\nsuch series of notes is downgraded below a certain rating level (or subsequently upgraded). The maximum adjustment is 2.000 percent above the initial interest\nrate and the interest rate cannot be reduced below the initial interest rate. As of May 25, 2025, no such adjustments have been made to this rate.\nThrough our shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, depending on conditions prevailing in the public capital markets, we may from time to time\nissue equity securities or unsecured debt securities in one or more series, which may consist of notes, debentures or other evidences of indebtedness in one or\nmore offerings.\nFrom time to time, we or our affiliates, may repurchase our outstanding debt in privately negotiated transactions, open-market transactions or otherwise.\nSuch repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts\ninvolved may be material.\nFrom time to time, we enter into interest rate derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk inherent in our operations. See Note 8 of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this report).\nA summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at May 25, 2025, is as follows:\n(in millions) Payments Due by Period\nContractual Obligations TotalLess Than\n1 Year1-3\nYears3-5\nYearsMore Than\n5 Years\nLong-term debt (1) $ 3,021.5 $ 106.4 $ 1,084.9 $ 481.6 $ 1,348.6 \nLeases (2) 3,066.0 527.8 982.7 712.9 842.6 \nPurchase obligations (3) 547.6 500.8 46.8 \u2014 \u2014 \nBenefit obligations (4) 321.3 32.4 64.6 64.4 159.9 \nUnrecognized income tax benefits (5) 23.7 1.6 4.6 17.5 \u2014 \nTotal contractual obligations $ 6,980.1 $ 1,169.0 $ 2,183.6 $ 1,276.4 $ 2,351.1 \n(in millions) Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period\nOther Commercial CommitmentsTotal\nAmounts\nCommittedLess Than\n1 Year1-3\nYears3-5\nYearsMore Than\n5 Years\nStandby letters of credit (6) $ 96.7 $ 96.7 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 \nGuarantees (7) 76.5 26.6 32.5 14.9 2.5 \nTotal commercial commitments $ 173.2 $ 123.3 $ 32.5 $ 14.9 $ 2.5 \n(1)Includes interest payments associated with existing long-term debt.

As\nof May 25, 2025, our adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio was 2.1. For fiscal 2025, the lease-debt equivalent includes 6.00 times the total annual minimum rent for\nconsolidated lease obligations of $498.1 million. The calculation of adjusted debt to EBITDAR ratio is shown in the following table:\n(in millions, except ratios) May 25, 2025\nLong-term debt, excluding unamortized discount and issuance costs and fair value hedge $ 2,189.1 \nLease-debt equivalent 2,988.9 \nGuarantees 76.5\nAdjusted Debt $ 5,254.5 \nCalculation of EBITDAR\nEarnings from continuing operations $ 1,051.0 \nDepreciation and amortization 516.1 \nInterest, net 175.1 \nIncome tax expense 136.2 \nImpairments and disposal of assets, net 49.2 \nTransaction and integration costs 51.1 \nNon-cash stock based compensation 79.1 \nMinimum rent 498.1 \nAdjusted EBITDAR $ 2,555.9 \nAdjusted Debt/ EBITDAR Ratio 2.1 \nPrior to the Amendment, the ratio was calculated as adjusted debt to adjusted total capital and the maximum permitted was 75 percent. As of May 26,\n2024, our adjusted debt to adjusted capital ratio was 66 percent. For fiscal 2024, the lease-debt equivalent includes 6.00 times the total annual minimum rent\nfor consolidated lease obligations of $464.4 million. The composition of our capital structure is shown in the following table:\n(in millions, except ratios) May 26, 2024\nCapital Structure\nShort-term debt $ 86.8 \nLong-term debt, excluding unamortized discount and issuance costs and fair value hedge 1,439.1 \nTotal debt $ 1,525.9 \nStockholders\u2019 equity 2,242.5 \nTotal capital $ 3,768.4 \nCalculation of Adjusted Capital\nTotal debt $ 1,525.9 \nLease-debt equivalent 2,786.4 \nGuarantees 71.0 \nAdjusted debt $ 4,383.3 \nStockholders\u2019 equity 2,242.5 \nAdjusted total capital $ 6,625.8 \nCapital Structure Ratios\nDebt to total capital ratio 40 %\nAdjusted debt to adjusted total capital ratio 66 %\n39Based on these ratios, we believe our financial condition is strong. We include the lease-debt equivalent and contractual lease guarantees in our ratios\nreported to shareholders, as we believe its inclusion better represents the optimal capital structure that we target from period to period and because it is\nconsistent with the calculation of the covenant under our Revolving Credit Agreement.\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations were $1.71 billion and $1.62 billion in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. Net\ncash flows provided by operating activities include net earnings from continuing operations of $1.05 billion in fiscal 2025 and $1.03 billion in fiscal 2024. Net\ncash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased in fiscal 2025 primarily due to higher net earnings from continuing\noperations.\nNet cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations were $1.3 billion in fiscal 2025 and 2024. Capital expenditures incurred principally\nfor building new restaurants, remodeling existing restaurants, replacing equipment, and technology initiatives were $644.6 million in fiscal 2025, compared to\n$601.2 million in fiscal 2024. Net cash used in the acquisition of Chuy\u2019s was $613.7 million during fiscal 2025. Net cash used in the acquisition of Ruth\u2019s Chris\nwas $701.1 million during fiscal 2024.\nNet cash flows used in financing activities from continuing operations were $385.8 million and $483.4 million in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. Net\ncash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2025 included dividend payments of $658.5 million, share repurchases of $418.2 million and repayment of\ncommercial paper of $86.8 million, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of long-debt of $750.0 million and proceeds from the exercise of\nemployee stock options. Net cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal 2024 included dividend payments of $628.4 million and share repurchases of\n$453.9 million, partially offset by the issuance of commercial paper of $86.8 million, net proceeds from the 2033 Notes of $500.0 million and proceeds from\nthe exercise of employee stock options. Dividends declared by our Board of Directors totaled $5.60 and $5.24 per share for fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nWe are not aware of any trends or events that would materially affect our capital requirements or liquidity. We believe that our internal cash-generating\ncapabilities, the potential issuance of equity or unsecured debt securities under our shelf registration statement and short-term commercial paper or drawings\nunder our Revolving Credit Agreement should be sufficient to finance our capital expenditures, debt maturities and other operating activities through fiscal\n2026.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe are not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial\ncondition, changes in financial condition, sales or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nOur total current assets were $937.7 million at May 25, 2025, compared with $822.8 million at May 26, 2024. The increase was primarily due to an\nincrease in cash and cash equivalents driven by cash from operations.\nOur total current liabilities were $2.25 billion at May 25, 2025 and $2.19 billion at May 26, 2024. The increase was primarily due to increases in accounts\npayable as well as an increase in other current liabilities associated with our non-qualified deferred compensation plan, operating and financing leases and sales\ntax liability.\nAPPLICATION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nSee Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this report) for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards.\nItem 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to a variety of market risks, including fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, compensation and commodity prices.\nTo manage this exposure, we periodically enter into interest rate, foreign currency exchange instruments, equity forward and commodity derivative instruments\nfor other than trading purposes. See Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this report).\nWe use the variance/covariance method to measure value at risk, over time horizons ranging from one week to one year, at the 95 percent confidence\nlevel. At May 25, 2025, our potential losses in future net earnings resulting from changes in equity forwards, commodity instruments, currencies and floating\nrate and fixed rate debt interest rate exposures were approximately $63.3 million over a period of one year. The value at risk from an increase in the fair value\nof all of our long-term fixed-rate debt,\n40over a period of one year, was approximately $121.1 million. The fair value of our long-term fixed-rate debt outstanding as of May 25, 2025, averaged $1.89\nbillion, with a high of $2.17 billion and a low of $1.37 billion during fiscal 2025. Our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest\nrate changes on earnings and cash flows by targeting an appropriate mix of variable and fixed-rate debt.\n41Item 8.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPage\nReport of Management Responsibilities 43\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 43\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 44\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (KPMG LLP, Orlando, FL, Auditor Firm ID: 185) 45\nConsolidated Statements of Earnings for the fiscal years ended May 25, 2025, May 26, 2024 and May 28, 2023 47\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the fiscal years ended May 25, 2025, May 26, 2024 and May 28, 2023 48\nConsolidated Balance Sheets at May 25, 2025 and May 26, 2024 49\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders\u2019 Equity for the fiscal years ended May 25, 2025, May 26, 2024 and May 28, 2023 50\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the fiscal years ended May 25, 2025, May 26, 2024 and May 28, 2023 51\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements 53\n42REPORT OF MANAGEMENT\u2019S RESPONSIBILITIES\nThe management of Darden Restaurants, Inc. is responsible for the fairness and accuracy of the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated\nfinancial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, using management\u2019s best estimates and judgments\nwhere appropriate. The financial information throughout this report is consistent with our consolidated financial statements.\nManagement has established a system of internal controls over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance that assets are adequately\nsafeguarded and transactions are recorded accurately, in all material respects, in accordance with management\u2019s authorization. Our internal controls provide for\nappropriate segregation of duties and responsibilities and there are documented policies regarding utilization of our assets and proper financial reporting. These\nformally stated and regularly communicated policies set high standards of ethical conduct for all employees. We also maintain a strong audit program that\nindependently evaluates the adequacy of the design and operating effectiveness of these internal controls.\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors meets at least quarterly to determine that management, internal auditors and the independent registered\npublic accounting firm are properly discharging their duties regarding internal control and financial reporting. Management, internal auditors and the\nindependent registered public accounting firm have full and free access to the Audit Committee at any time.\nKPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, is retained to audit our consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting. Their reports follow.\nMANAGEMENT\u2019S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the\nCompany\u2019s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation\nof effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of May 25, 2025. In making this assessment,\nmanagement used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated\nFramework (2013). Management has concluded that, as of May 25, 2025, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on these\ncriteria.\nThe Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm KPMG LLP, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over\nfinancial reporting, which follows.\n/s/ Ricardo Cardenas\nRicardo Cardenas\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n43Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nDarden Restaurants, Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Darden Restaurants, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of May 25, 2025, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our\nopinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 25, 2025, based on criteria established\nin Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated\nbalance sheets of the Company as of May 25, 2025 and May 26, 2024, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, changes in\nstockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended May 25, 2025, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated\nfinancial statements), and our report dated July 18, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness\nof internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered\nwith the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial\nreporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting\nand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control\nover financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly\nreflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation\nof effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nOrlando, Florida\nJuly 18, 2025\n44Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nDarden Restaurants, Inc.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Darden Restaurants, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of May 25, 2025 and May\n26, 2024, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the\nthree-year period ended May 25, 2025, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial\nstatements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of May 25, 2025 and May 26, 2024, and the results of its operations\nand its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended May 25, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s\ninternal control over financial reporting as of May 25, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated July 18, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the\neffectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these\nconsolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission\nand the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included\nperforming procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating\nthe overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated\nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter\nin any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing\na separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation of long-lived assets for impairment\nAs discussed in Notes 1, 5, and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, land, buildings and equipment, net and operating lease right-of-use assets\nwere $8.3 billion as of May 25, 2025. The Company tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an\nasset group may not be recoverable. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in expected future cash flows and changes in the expected\nuseful life which relates to the Company\u2019s intent and ability to hold its asset groups for a period that recovers their carrying value.\nWe identified the evaluation of indicators of potential long-lived assets impairment as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was required to\nevaluate certain assumptions in the Company\u2019s analysis, including expected future cash flows and the expected useful life. Adverse changes in these\nassumptions could have a significant impact on whether an indicator has been identified and could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n45The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating\neffectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s long-lived asset impairment process, including controls over the identification of indicators of\nimpairment and the assumptions listed above. For certain asset groups, we compared the expected future cash flows used by the Company in its evaluation of\nindicators of potential long-lived asset impairment to historical results. We evaluated the expected useful life for certain asset groups by inspecting underlying\ndocuments, such as real estate meeting minutes and other documents to assess the Company\u2019s plans to dispose or close asset groups. We corroborated the\nCompany\u2019s plans with others in the organization who are responsible for, and have authority over, disposition and closure activities.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1996.\nOrlando, Florida\nJuly 18, 2025\n46DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS\n(In millions, except per share data)\nFiscal Year Ended\nMay 25, 2025 May 26, 2024 May 28, 2023\nSales $ 12,076.7 $ 11,390.0 $ 10,487.8 \nCosts and expenses:\nFood and beverage 3,657.0 3,523.9 3,355.9 \nRestaurant labor 3,833.1 3,619.3 3,346.3 \nRestaurant expenses 1,944.0 1,812.3 1,676.3 \nMarketing expenses 169.9 144.5 118.3 \nPre-opening costs 24.8 24.3 25.9 \nGeneral and administrative expenses 520.3 479.2 386.1 \nDepreciation and amortization 516.1 459.9 387.8 \nImpairments and disposal of assets, net 49.2 12.4 (10.6)\nTotal operating costs and expenses $ 10,714.4 $ 10,075.8 $ 9,286.0 \nOperating income $ 1,362.3 $ 1,314.2 $ 1,201.8 \nInterest, net 175.1 138.7 81.3 \nEarnings before income taxes $ 1,187.2 $ 1,175.5 $ 1,120.5 \nIncome tax expense 136.2 145.0 137.0 \nEarnings from continuing operations $ 1,051.0 $ 1,030.5 $ 983.5 \nLosses from discontinued operations, net of tax benefit of $0.8, $1.7 and $0.8, respectively (1.4) (2.9) (1.6)\nNet earnings $ 1,049.6 $ 1,027.6 $ 981.9 \nBasic net earnings per share:\nEarnings from continuing operations $ 8.94 $ 8.59 $ 8.07 \nLosses from discontinued operations (0.01) (0.02) (0.01)\nNet earnings $ 8.93 $ 8.57 $ 8.06 \nDiluted net earnings per share:\nEarnings from continuing operations $ 8.88 $ 8.53 $ 8.00 \nLosses from discontinued operations (0.02) (0.02) (0.01)\nNet earnings $ 8.86 $ 8.51 $ 7.99 \nAverage number of common shares outstanding:\nBasic 117.5 119.9 121.9 \nDiluted 118.4 120.8 122.9 \nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n47DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(In millions)\nFiscal Year Ended\nMay 25, 2025 May 26, 2024 May 28, 2023\nNet earnings $ 1,049.6 $ 1,027.6 $ 981.9 \nForeign currency adjustment \u2014 0.1 (0.3)\nChange in fair value of derivatives and amortization of unrecognized gains and losses on\nderivatives, net of taxes of $(1.0), $9.4 and $(1.5), respectively 5.9 20.6 4.3 \nNet unamortized gain arising during period, including amortization of unrecognized net\nactuarial loss, net of taxes of $0.2, $0.6 and $0.4, respectively 0.3 1.7 1.1 \nOther comprehensive income $ 6.2 $ 22.4 $ 5.1 \nTotal comprehensive income $ 1,055.8 $ 1,050.0 $ 987.0 \nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n48DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions)  \nMay 25, 2025 May 26, 2024\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 240.0 $ 194.8 \nReceivables, net 93.8 79.1 \nInventories 311.6 290.5 \nPrepaid income taxes 135.6 121.7 \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 156.7 136.7 \nTotal current assets $ 937.7 $ 822.8 \nLand, buildings and equipment, net 4,716.0 4,184.3 \nOperating lease right-of-use assets 3,555.9 3,429.3 \nGoodwill 1,659.4 1,391.0 \nTrademarks 1,346.4 1,148.0 \nOther assets 371.6 347.6 \nTotal assets $ 12,587.0 $ 11,323.0 \nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 439.6 $ 399.5 \nShort-term debt \u2014 86.8 \nAccrued payroll 207.5 190.1 \nAccrued income taxes 4.7 6.1 \nOther accrued taxes 83.0 71.0 \nUnearned revenues 599.4 591.8 \nOther current liabilities 913.3 847.2 \nTotal current liabilities $ 2,247.5 $ 2,192.5 \nLong-term debt 2,128.9 1,370.4 \nDeferred income taxes 278.8 232.0 \nOperating lease liabilities - non-current 3,816.9 3,704.7 \nOther liabilities 1,803.6 1,580.9 \nTotal liabilities $ 10,275.7 $ 9,080.5 \nStockholders\u2019 equity:\nCommon stock and surplus, no par value.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the operations of Darden Restaurants, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (Darden, the\nCompany, we, us or our). We own and operate the Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen, Chuy\u2019s, Yard House, Ruth\u2019s Chris\nSteak House(\u201cRuth\u2019s Chris\u201d), The Capital Grille, Seasons 52, Eddie V\u2019s Prime Seafood (Eddie V\u2019s), Bahama Breeze, and The Capital Burger restaurant\nbrands located in the United States and Canada. Through subsidiaries, we own and operate all of our restaurants in the United States and Canada, except for 5\nrestaurants we manage through joint venture or other contractual agreements and 85 franchised restaurants. We also have 69 franchised restaurants located in\nCanada, Latin America, the Caribbean, Asia, and the Middle East. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in\nconsolidation.\nOn October 11, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Chuy\u2019s Holdings Inc. (Chuy\u2019s), a Delaware corporation, for $37.50 per share in cash. See Note 2,\nAcquisition of Chuy\u2019s.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (APA) with Recipe Unlimited Corporation (\u201cRecipe\u201d). Pursuant to\nthe APA, we agreed to sell the assets of all eight Olive Garden restaurants located in Canada and certain operating liabilities related thereto, and Recipe agreed\nto purchase such assets and liabilities and franchise the operations of the restaurants as part of their current franchise portfolio. The APA was signed on April\n25, 2025 for an agreed upon sale price of 60.0 million Canadian dollars less the assumption of certain liabilities as part of the transaction. At closing, Darden\nand Recipe entered into an area development and franchise agreement, pursuant to which Recipe will operate under the Olive Garden tradename and will pay\nroyalties for use of the tradename.\nThe sale successfully closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, and the gain on the sale will be evaluated and recognized in the first quarter of 2026. All\nassets and liabilities related to this transaction have been classified as held for sale and are primarily included within prepaid expenses and other current assets\nand other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.\nIn our June 2025 earnings call, we announced the decision to explore strategic alternatives for the Bahama Breeze brand, which includes 28 locations\nowned and operated by Darden and one franchise location. We will be exploring a sale of the brand or conversions of some or all of these locations to other\nDarden brands. The Bahama Breeze assets did not meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale as of the end of fiscal 2025.\nFor fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, all gains and losses on disposition, impairment charges and disposal costs, along with the sales, costs and expenses and\nincome taxes attributable to the sale of Red Lobster, have been classified as discontinued locations, and have been aggregated in a single caption entitled\n\u201cLosses from discontinued operations, net of tax benefit\u201d in our consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented. Neither the pending sale of our\neight Olive Garden Canada restaurants nor our recent announcement to explore strategic alternatives for Bahama Breeze meet the requirements to be classified\nas discontinued operations.\nFiscal Year\nWe operate on a 52/53-week fiscal year, which ends on the last Sunday in May. Fiscal 2025, which ended May 25, 2025, consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal\n2024, which ended May 26, 2024, consisted of 52 weeks and fiscal 2023, which ended May 28, 2023, consisted of 52 weeks.\nUse of Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of these\nfinancial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets\nand liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ\nfrom those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash equivalents include highly liquid investments such as bank deposits and money market funds that have an original maturity of three months or less.\nAmounts receivable from credit card companies are also considered cash equivalents because they are both short term and highly liquid in nature and are\ntypically converted to cash within three days of the sales transaction.\u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n\u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n53NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nThe components of cash and cash equivalents are as follows:\n(in millions) May 25, 2025 May 26, 2024\nShort-term investments $ 21.3 $ 2.8 \nCredit card receivables 176.8 153.0 \nDepository accounts 41.9 39.0 \nTotal cash and cash equivalents $ 240.0 $ 194.8 \nAs of May 25, 2025, and May 26, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalent accounts in excess of insured limits. We manage the credit risk of our positions\nthrough utilizing multiple financial institutions and monitoring the credit quality of those financial institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents. We had\nrestricted cash of $14.5 million as of May 25, 2025 and $25.3 million as of May 26, 2024, which represents cash held as security for a standby letter of credit.\nRestricted cash is included in Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets on the balance sheet. See Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies.\nReceivables, Net\nReceivables, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, represent their estimated net realizable value. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded\nbased on historical collection experience and the age of the receivables. Receivables are written off when they are deemed uncollectible. See Note 12 for\nadditional information.\nInventories\nInventories consist of food and beverages and are valued at the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable value.\nLand, Buildings and Equipment, Net\nLand, buildings and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Building components are depreciated over estimated useful lives\nranging from 3 to 30 years using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements, which are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of\nbuildings in land, buildings and equipment, net, are amortized over the lesser of the expected lease term or the estimated useful lives of the related assets using\nthe straight-line method. Equipment is depreciated over estimated useful lives ranging from 2 to 20 years also using the straight-line method. See Note 5 for\nadditional information. Gains and losses on the disposal of land, buildings and equipment are included in impairments and disposal of assets, net, while the\nwrite-off of net book value associated with the replacement of equipment in the normal course of business is recorded as a component of restaurant expenses in\nour accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. Depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations associated with buildings and\nequipment and losses on replacement of equipment were as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended\n(in millions) May 25, 2025 May 26, 2024 May 28, 2023\nDepreciation and amortization on buildings and equipment $ 496.1 $ 435.1 $ 367.4 \nLosses on replacement of equipment 3.9 3.0 2.2 \n \nCapitalized Software Costs and Other Definite-Lived Intangibles\nCapitalized software, which is a component of other assets, is recorded at cost less accumulated amortization. Capitalized software is amortized using the\nstraight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 10 years. The cost of capitalized software and related accumulated amortization was as\nfollows:\n(in millions) May 25, 2025 May 26, 2024\nCapitalized software $ 314.8 $ 292.2 \nAccumulated amortization (231.8) (216.5)\nCapitalized software, net of accumulated amortization $ 83.0 $ 75.7 \n54NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nWe have other definite-lived intangible assets, including assets related to the value of reacquired franchise rights resulting from our acquisitions that are\nincluded as a component of other assets and definite-lived intangible liabilities related to the value of below-market agreements resulting from our acquisitions\nthat are included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Definite-lived intangibles are amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful\nlives of 1 to 20 years. The cost and related accumulated amortization was as follows:\n(in millions) May 25, 2025 May 26, 2024\nDefinite-lived intangible assets $ 30.7 $ 30.7 \nAccumulated amortization (16.4) (14.5)\nDefinite-lived intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization $ 14.3 $ 16.2 \nDefinite-lived intangible liabilities $ (3.0)$ (3.0)\nAccumulated amortization 2.4 2.1 \nDefinite-lived intangible liabilities, net of accumulated amortization $ (0.6)$ (0.9)\nAmortization expense from continuing operations associated with capitalized software and other definite-lived intangibles included in depreciation and\namortization in our accompanying consolidated statements of earnings was as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended\n(in millions) May 25, 2025 May 26, 2024 May 28, 2023\nAmortization expense - capitalized software $ 18.2 $ 22.9 $ 18.6 \nAmortization expense - other definite-lived intangibles 1.8 1.9 1.8 \nBased on the net book values of our definite-lived intangible assets and liabilities at May 25, 2025, we expect amortization of capitalized software and\nother definite-lived intangible assets will be approximately $25.0 million annually for fiscal 2026 through 2030.\nTrust-Owned Life Insurance\nWe have a trust that purchased life insurance policies covering certain of our officers and other key employees (trust-owned life insurance or TOLI). The\ntrust is the owner and sole beneficiary of the TOLI policies. The policies were purchased to offset a portion of our obligations under our non-qualified deferred\ncompensation plan. The cash surrender value for each policy is included in other assets, while changes in cash surrender values are included in general and\nadministrative expenses.\nLiquor Licenses\nThe costs of obtaining non-transferable liquor licenses that are directly issued by local government agencies for nominal fees are expensed as incurred.\nThe costs of purchasing transferable liquor licenses through open markets in jurisdictions with a limited number of authorized liquor licenses are capitalized as\nindefinite-lived intangible assets and included in other assets. Liquor licenses are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Annual liquor license renewal fees are expensed over the renewal term.\n55NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nOur goodwill and trademark balances are allocated as follows:\nGoodwill Trademarks\n(in millions) May 25, 2025 May 26, 2024 May 25, 2025 May 26, 2024\nOlive Garden $ 30.2 $ 30.2 $ 0.7 $ 0.7 \nLongHorn Steakhouse 49.3 49.3 307.8 307.8 \nCheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen 165.1 165.1 230.1 230.1 \nChuy\u2019s 268.4 \u2014 198.4 \u2014 \nYard House 369.2 369.2 109.3 109.3 \nRuth\u2019s Chris 353.6 353.6 341.7 341.7 \nThe Capital Grille 401.6 401.6 147.4 147.4 \nSeasons 52 \u2014 \u2014 0.5 0.5 \nEddie V\u2019s 22.0 22.0 10.5 10.5 \nTotal $ 1,659.4 $ 1,391.0 $ 1,346.4 $ 1,148.0 \nWe have eleven reporting units, eight of which have goodwill and nine of which have trademarks. Goodwill and trademarks are not subject to\namortization and have been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing. The reporting units are our restaurant brands. A significant amount\nof judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include, among others: a significant decline in our\nexpected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the\nbusiness climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and slower growth rates. Any\nadverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated\nfinancial statements. We review our goodwill and trademarks for impairment annually, as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter, or more frequently if\nindicators of impairment exist .\nDuring fiscal 2025, we elected to perform a qualitative assessment for our annual review of goodwill and trademarks to determine whether or not\nindicators of impairment exist. In considering the qualitative approach related to goodwill, we evaluated factors including, but not limited to, macro-economic\nconditions, market and industry conditions, commodity cost fluctuations, competitive environment, share price performance, results of prior impairment tests,\noperational stability, the overall financial performance of the reporting units and the impacts of discount rates. As it relates to trademarks, we evaluate similar\nfactors from the goodwill assessment, in addition to impacts of royalty rates. As a result of the qualitative assessment, no indicators of impairment were\nidentified, and no additional indicators of impairment were identified through the end of our fourth fiscal quarter that would require us to test further for\nimpairment.\nWe evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets to determine if they are definite or indefinite-lived. A determination on useful life requires\nsignificant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the\nindustry, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required\nmaintenance expenditures and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.\nImpairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets\nLand, buildings and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and certain other assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for\nimpairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be\nheld and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the\nassets. Identifiable cash flows are measured at the lowest level for which they are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities,\ngenerally at the restaurant level. If such assets are determined to be impaired, the recognized impairment is measured by the amount by which the carrying\namount of the assets exceeds their fair value. Fair value is generally determined based on appraisals, sales prices of comparable assets or discounted future net\ncash flows expected to be generated by the assets. Restaurant sites and certain other assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount\nor fair value, less estimated costs to sell, and are included in assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets when certain criteria are met. These criteria\ninclude, among other factors, the requirement that the likelihood of disposing of these assets within one year is probable. Assets not meeting the \u201cheld for sale\u201d\ncriteria remain in land, buildings and equipment until their disposal is probable within one year.\nWe account for exit or disposal activities, including restaurant closures, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting\nStandards Codification (ASC) Topic 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations. Such costs include the\n56NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\ncost of disposing of the assets as well as other facility-related expenses from previously closed restaurants. These costs are generally expensed as incurred. See\nNote 4 for additional information. For restaurants operated under non-cancellable leases, on the date we commit to a plan to either abandon the related right-of-\nuse (ROU) asset or sublease the underlying asset, we evaluate the ROU asset for potential impairment and determine the go-forward accounting based on the\nrequirements in FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases.\nInsurance Accruals\nThrough the use of insurance program deductibles and self-insurance, we retain a significant portion of expected losses under our workers\u2019 compensation\nand general liability programs. Accrued liabilities have been recorded based on our estimates of the anticipated ultimate costs to settle all claims, both reported\nand not yet reported.\nRevenue Recognition\nSales, as presented in our consolidated statements of earnings, includes the sale of food and beverage products, royalties from our franchised restaurants\nand royalties from the sale of consumer product goods. Revenue from restaurant sales is recognized when food and beverage products are sold and is presented\nnet of discounts, coupons, employee meals and complimentary meals. Revenue is presented net of sales tax. Sales taxes collected from customers are included\nin other accrued taxes on our consolidated balance sheets until the taxes are remitted to governmental authorities.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we entered into an exclusive multi-year delivery arrangement with Uber Technologies, Inc. (Uber). The\nagreement enables our guests to order delivery via Darden restaurant channels, with delivery handled by Uber. During fiscal 2025, we rolled the program out to\nnearly all Olive Garden locations and began the rollout to Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen. Revenue from orders through Company-owned platforms includes\ndelivery fees and is recognized when the delivery partner transfers the order to the guest as the Company controls the delivery. For these sales, the Company\nreceives payment directly from the guest at the time of sale. For all delivery sales, the Company is considered the principal and recognizes revenue on a gross\nbasis.\nFranchise royalties, which are a percentage of net sales of franchised restaurants, are recognized as revenue in the period the related sales occur. Revenue\nfrom area development and franchise fees are recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied over the term of the franchise agreement, which is\ngenerally 10 years. Advertising contributions, which are a percentage of net sales of franchised restaurants, are recognized in the period the related sales occur.\nAdditionally, franchisee purchases of our inventory through our distribution network are recognized as revenue in the period the purchases are made.\nRevenue from the sale of consumer packaged goods includes ongoing royalty fees based on a percentage of licensed retail product sales and is recognized\nupon the sale of product by our licensed manufacturers to retail outlets.\nUnearned Revenues\nUnearned revenues primarily represent our liability for gift cards that have been sold but not yet redeemed. We recognize sales from our gift cards when\nthe gift card is redeemed by the customer. Although there are no expiration dates or dormancy fees for our gift cards, based on our analysis of our historical gift\ncard redemption patterns, we can reasonably estimate the amount of gift cards for which redemption is remote, which is referred to as \u201cbreakage.\u201d We\nrecognize breakage within sales for unused gift card amounts in proportion to actual gift card redemptions. The estimated value of gift cards expected to remain\nunused is recognized over the expected period of redemption as the remaining gift card values are redeemed, generally over a period of 12 years. Utilizing this\nmethod, we estimate both the amount of breakage and the time period of redemption. If actual redemption patterns vary from our estimates, actual gift card\nbreakage income may differ from the amounts recorded. We update our estimates of our redemption period and our breakage rate periodically and apply that\nrate prospectively to gift card redemptions. Discounts for gift cards sold by third parties are recorded to unearned revenues and are recognized as a reduction to\nsales over a period that approximates redemption patterns. \nFood and Beverage Costs\nFood and beverage costs include inventory, warehousing, related purchasing and distribution costs, and gains and losses on certain commodity derivative\ncontracts. Vendor allowances received in connection with the purchase of a vendor\u2019s products are recognized as a reduction of the related food and beverage\ncosts as earned. For certain contracts, advance payments are made by the vendors based on estimates of volume to be purchased from the vendors and the terms\nof the agreement. As we make purchases from the vendors each period, we recognize the pro rata portion of allowances earned as a reduction of food and\nbeverage costs for that period. Differences between estimated and actual purchases are settled in accordance with the terms of the agreements. Vendor\nagreements are generally for a period of one year or more. Pre-payments received from vendors are initially recorded as long-term liabilities. Amounts\nexpected to be earned within one year are recorded as current liabilities. Certain agreements require payments in arrears and are recorded as current\nreceivables.\n57NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nIncome Taxes\nWe provide for federal and state income taxes currently payable as well as for those deferred because of temporary differences between reporting income\nand expenses for financial statement purposes versus tax purposes. Federal income tax credits are recorded as a reduction of income taxes. Deferred tax assets\nand liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and\nliabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years\nin which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is\nrecognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date. Interest recognized on reserves for uncertain tax positions is included in income tax\nexpense in our consolidated statements of earnings. A corresponding liability for accrued interest is included as a component of other current liabilities on our\nconsolidated balance sheets. Interest accrued for refunds due from the taxing jurisdiction is recognized as a reduction to tax expense and a component of taxes\npayable. Penalties, when incurred, are recognized in general and administrative expenses.\nFASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized (or derecognized) in the financial\nstatements when it is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities.\nA recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. See\nNote 13 for additional information.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWe enter into derivative instruments for risk management purposes only, including derivatives designated as hedging instruments as required by FASB\nASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and those utilized as economic hedges. We use financial and commodities derivatives to manage interest rate,\ncompensation and commodity and foreign exchange pricing risks inherent in our business operations. Our use of derivative instruments is currently limited to\ninterest rate hedges, equity forward contracts, commodity swaps and foreign exchange forwards. These instruments are generally structured as hedges of the\nvariability of cash flows related to forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges). However, we do at times enter into instruments designated as fair value hedges\nto reduce our exposure to changes in fair value of the related hedged item. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes,\nwhere changes in the cash flows or fair value of the derivative are not expected to offset changes in cash flows or fair value of the hedged item. All derivatives\nare recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. For those derivative instruments for which we intend to elect hedge accounting, on the date the derivative\ncontract is entered into, we document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk-management objective and strategy\nfor undertaking the various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on\nthe consolidated balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions. We also formally assess, both at the hedge\u2019s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether\nthe derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.\nBy using these instruments, we expose ourselves, from time to time, to credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform\nunder the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes us, which creates credit risk for us. We\nminimize this credit risk by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties. Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument\nthat results from a change in interest rates, commodity prices, or the market price of our common stock. We minimize this market risk by establishing and\nmonitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken.\nTo the extent our derivatives are effective in offsetting the variability of the hedged cash flows, and otherwise meet the cash flow hedge accounting\ncriteria required by FASB ASC Topic 815, changes in the derivatives\u2019 fair value are not included in current earnings but are included in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss), net of tax. These changes in fair value will be reclassified into earnings at the time of the forecasted transaction. Ineffectiveness\nmeasured in the hedging relationship is recorded currently in earnings in the period in which it occurs. To the extent our derivatives are effective in mitigating\nchanges in fair value, and otherwise meet the fair value hedge accounting criteria required by FASB ASC Topic 815, gains and losses in the derivatives\u2019 fair\nvalue are included in current earnings, as are the gains and losses of the related hedged item. To the extent the hedge accounting criteria are not met, the\nderivative contracts are utilized as economic hedges, and changes in the fair value of such contracts are recorded currently in earnings in the period in which\nthey occur. Cash flows related to derivatives are included in operating activities. See Note 8 for additional information.\nLeases\nThe majority of our restaurant locations, as well as our restaurant support center, are subject to a lease. We evaluate our leases at the commencement of\nthe lease to determine the classification as an operating or finance lease. Upon adoption of FASB ASC Topic 842, we recognized operating and finance lease\nliabilities based on the present value of minimum lease payments over the remaining expected lease term and corresponding right-of-use assets. We recognize\nlease expense related to operating leases\n58NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\non a straight-line basis. Amortization expense and interest expense related to finance leases are included in depreciation and amortization and interest, net,\nrespectively, in our consolidated statements of earnings. Sale-leasebacks are transactions through which we sell assets (such as restaurant properties) at fair\nvalue and subsequently lease them back. The resulting leases qualify and are accounted for as operating leases. Failed sale-leaseback transactions are generally\nclassified as finance leases and result in retention of the \u201csold\u201d assets within land, buildings and equipment with a finance lease liability equal to the amount of\nproceeds received recorded as a component of other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWithin the provisions of certain of our leases, there are rent holidays and escalations in payments over the base lease term, as well as renewal periods. The\neffects of the holidays and escalations have been reflected in lease expense on a straight-line basis for operating leases over the expected lease term. The lease\nterm commences on the date when we have the right to control the use of the leased property, which is typically before lease payments are due under the terms\nof the lease. Many of our leases have renewal periods totaling 5 to 20 years, exercisable at our option, and require payment of property taxes, insurance and\nmaintenance costs in addition to the lease payments. At lease inception, we include option periods that we are reasonably certain to exercise as failure to renew\nthe lease would impose an economic penalty either from the loss of our investment in leasehold improvements or future cash flows from operating the\nrestaurant. The consolidated financial statements reflect the same lease term for amortizing leasehold improvements as we use to determine finance versus\noperating lease classifications. Variable lease expense is generally based on sales levels and is accrued at the point in time we determine that it is probable that\nsuch sales levels will be achieved. Landlord allowances are recorded as an adjustment to the right-of-use assets. Gains and losses on sale-leaseback transactions\nare recognized immediately. We elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for real estate leases entered into after adoption.\nSee Note 11 for additional information.\nPre-Opening Expenses\nNon-capital expenditures associated with opening new restaurants are expensed as incurred; these costs consist of expense incurred before the opening of\na new, relocated or converted restaurant and include occupancy, labor, travel, training, food, beverage and other initial supplies and expenses. These costs are\nreported as pre-opening costs in our consolidated statements of earnings.\nAdvertising\nProduction costs of commercials are expensed in the fiscal period the advertising is first aired while the costs of programming and other advertising,\npromotion and marketing programs are expensed as incurred. These costs are reported as marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of earnings.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize the cost of employee service received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards. We\nrecognize compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the employee service period for awards granted. We utilize the\nBlack-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. The dividend yield has been estimated based upon our historical results\nand expectations for changes in dividend rates. The expected volatility was determined using historical stock prices. The risk-free interest rate was the rate\navailable on zero coupon U.S. government obligations with a term approximating the expected life of each grant. The expected life was estimated based on the\nexercise history of previous grants, taking into consideration the remaining contractual period for outstanding awards. We utilize a Monte Carlo simulation to\nestimate the fair value of our market-based equity-settled performance awards. The dividend yield assumes reinvestment of dividends. The expected volatility\nwas determined using historical stock prices. The risk-free interest rate was the rate available on zero coupon U.S. government obligations with a term\napproximating the expected life of each grant. The expected life was estimated based on the performance measurement period for outstanding awards. See Note\n15 for further information.\nNet Earnings per Share\nBasic net earnings per share are computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the reporting\nperiod. Diluted net earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or\nconverted into common stock. Outstanding stock options, restricted stock units and equity-settled performance stock units granted by us represent the only\ndilutive effect reflected in diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. These stock-based compensation instruments do not impact the numerator of the\ndiluted net earnings per share computation.\n59NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nThe following table presents the computation of basic and diluted net earnings per common share:\nFiscal Year Ended\n(in millions, except per share data) May 25, 2025 May 26, 2024 May 28, 2023\nEarnings from continuing operations $ 1,051.0 $ 1,030.5 $ 983.5 \nLosses from discontinued operations (1.4) (2.9) (1.6)\nNet earnings $ 1,049.6 $ 1,027.6 $ 981.9 \nWeighted average common shares outstanding \u2013 Basic 117.5 119.9 121.9 \nEffect of dilutive stock-based compensation 0.9 0.9 1.0 \nWeighted average common shares outstanding \u2013 Diluted 118.4 120.8 122.9 \nBasic net earnings per share:\nEarnings from continuing operations $ 8.94 $ 8.59 $ 8.07 \nLosses from discontinued operations (0.01) (0.02) (0.01)\nNet earnings $ 8.93 $ 8.57 $ 8.06 \nDiluted net earnings per share:\nEarnings from continuing operations $ 8.88 $ 8.53 $ 8.00 \nLosses from discontinued operations (0.02) (0.02) (0.01)\nNet earnings $ 8.86 $ 8.51 $ 7.99 \nStock options, restricted stock units and equity-settled performance stock units excluded from the calculation of diluted net earnings per share because the\neffect would have been anti-dilutive, are as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended\n(in millions) May 25, 2025 May 26, 2024 May 28, 2023\nAnti-dilutive stock-based compensation awards 0.1 0.1 0.3 \nForeign Currency\nThe Canadian dollar is the functional currency for our Canadian restaurant operations. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are\ntranslated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Results of operations are translated using the average exchange rates\nprevailing throughout the period. Translation gains and losses are reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss). Aggregate\ncumulative translation gains (losses) were $4.6 million at May 25, 2025 and May 26, 2024, respectively. Net gains (losses) from foreign currency transactions\nrecognized in our consolidated statements of earnings were $0.0 million for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Adopted\nAs of May 25, 2025, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment\nDisclosures, which updates reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The\nadoption of ASU 2023-07 did not impact the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flow, or financial condition. See Note 6 for the Company\u2019s segment\ndisclosures.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures, which updates income tax disclosures related to the rate reconciliation and requires disclosure of income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The\namendment also provides further disclosure comparability. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is\npermitted. The amendments should be applied prospectively; however, retrospective application is permitted. Management is currently evaluating this ASU to\ndetermine its impact on the Company\u2019s disclosures. We plan to adopt in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2026.\nIn March 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted its final rules intended to enhance and standardize climate-related\ndisclosures in registration statements and annual reports. The new rules will require disclosure of material climate-related risks, including disclosure of Board\nof Directors\u2019 oversight and risk management activities, the material impacts of these risks to the Company and the quantification of material impacts to the\nCompany as a result of severe weather\n60NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nevents and other natural conditions. The rules also require disclosure of material greenhouse gas emissions and any material climate-rated targets and goals.\nThe new rules will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning in fiscal year 2026, except for the greenhouse gas emissions disclosures which will be\neffective for annual reporting periods beginning in fiscal year 2027. On April 4, 2024, the SEC issued a voluntary stay on its final rules until legal challenges to\nthe rules are addressed, and on March 27, 2025, the SEC voted to end its defense of the rules requiring disclosure of climate-related risk and greenhouse gas\nemissions and withdrew from the litigation. The Company continues to monitor the status of these rules.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic\n220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which requires detailed disclosure amounts for purchases of inventory, employee compensation,\ndepreciation, and intangible asset amortization in each relevant expense caption on the income statement. The ASU requires companies to include amounts\nalready required by GAAP in the same disclosure, provide a qualitative description of remaining amounts not separately disaggregated, and disclose the total\nselling expenses along with the definition of selling expenses in annual reports. The amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026.\nEarly adoption is permitted. The amendment should be applied prospectively; however, retrospective application is permitted. Management is currently\nevaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company\u2019s disclosures. We plan to adopt in in fiscal 2028.\nNOTE 2 - ACQUISITION OF CHUY\u2019S\nOn October 11, 2024, we acquired 100 percent of the equity interest of Chuy\u2019s in an all-cash transaction of $649.1 million in total consideration,\n$613.7 million in net cash consideration, inclusive of the $35.4 million of cash on Chuy\u2019s Holdings balance sheet at closing. We financed the acquisition with a\nportion of the proceeds from the issuance of a $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.350 percent senior notes due 2027 and a $350.0 million\naggregate principal amount of 4.550 percent senior notes due 2029, which were issued on October 3, 2024. See Note 7 for additional information.\nThe acquired operations of Chuy\u2019s included 103 company-owned locations. The results of Chuy\u2019s operations are included in our consolidated financial\nstatements from the date of acquisition.\nThe assets and liabilities of Chuy\u2019s were recorded at their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition. We have determined the fair value of these\nassets, including land, buildings and equipment, and intangible assets, and liabilities, through internal studies and third-party valuations. The fair values set\nforth below are based on the results of those valuations. As of fiscal year ended May 25, 2025, we are pending additional information related to income tax\nassets and liabilities and as a result, those numbers are subject to adjustment in fiscal 2026.\nThe allocation of the purchase price as of fiscal year ended May 25, 2025 is as follows:\nBalances atAdjustments since\nacquisitionBalances at\n(in millions) October 11, 2024 May 25, 2025\nCash and cash equivalents $ 35.4 $ \u2014 $ 35.4 \nOther current assets 10.9 (0.4) 10.5 \nLand, buildings and equipment 204.3 (7.0) 197.3 \nOperating lease right-of-use assets 337.7 (5.8) 331.9 \nTrademark 198.4 \u2014 198.4 \nOther assets 6.1 \u2014 6.1 \nGoodwill 262.9 5.5 268.4 \n     Total assets acquired $ 1,055.7 $ (7.7)$ 1,048.0 \nCurrent liabilities 35.2 (0.8) 34.4 \nDeferred income taxes 43.0 (0.1) 42.9 \nOperating lease liabilities - non-current 328.4 (6.8) 321.6 \n     Total liabilities assumed $ 406.6 $ (7.7)$ 398.9 \nNet assets acquired $ 649.1 $ \u2014 $ 649.1 \n61NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nThe excess of the purchase price over the aggregate fair value of net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill in the amount of $268.4 million. The\nportion of the purchase price attributable to goodwill represents benefits expected because of the acquisition, including sales and unit growth opportunities in\naddition to supply-chain and support-cost synergies. The trademark has an indefinite life based on the expected use of the asset and the regulatory and\neconomic environment within which it is being used. The trademark represents a highly respected brand with positive connotations, and we intend to cultivate\nand protect the use of this brand. Goodwill and indefinite-lived trademarks are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if\nindicators of impairment exist. Buildings and equipment will be depreciated over a period of 1-30 years.\nAs a result of the acquisition and related integration efforts, we incurred expenses of $44.6 million ($36.7 million, net of tax) during the twelve months\nended May 25, 2025, which are included in general and administrative expenses and interest expense in our consolidated statements of earnings. Pro-forma\nfinancial information of the combined entities for periods prior to the acquisition is not presented due to the immaterial impact of the financial results of Chuy\u2019s\non our consolidated financial statements.\nNOTE 3 - REVENUE RECOGNITION\nDeferred revenue liabilities from contracts with customers included on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets is comprised of the following:\n(in millions) May 25, 2025 May 26, 2024\nUnearned revenues\nDeferred gift card revenue $ 628.8 $ 620.6 \nDeferred gift card discounts (30.1) (29.5)\nOther 0.7 0.7 \nTotal $ 599.4 $ 591.8 \nOther liabilities\nDeferred franchise fees - non-current $ 5.3 $ 4.9 \nThe following table presents a rollforward of deferred gift card revenue: \nFiscal Year Ended\n(in millions) May 25, 2025 May 26, 2024\nBeginning balance $ 620.6 $ 537.0 \nAcquired deferred gift card revenue 2.6 61.8 \nActivations 737.0 753.7 \nRedemptions and breakage (731.4) (731.9)\nEnding balance $ 628.8 $ 620.6 \nNOTE 4 - IMPAIRMENTS AND DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, NET\nImpairments and disposal of assets, net, in our accompanying consolidated statements of earnings are comprised of the following:\nFiscal Year Ended\n(in millions) May 25, 2025 May 26, 2024 May 28, 2023\nRestaurant impairments $ 0.1 $ 0.3 $ 2.4 \nDisposal (gains) losses 48.1 13.1 (15.1)\nOther 1.0 (1.0) 2.1 \nImpairments and disposal of assets, net $ 49.2 $ 12.4 $ (10.6)\n62Restaurant impairments and disposal losses for fiscal 2025 were mainly related to the decision to close twenty-two restaurant locations due to\nunderperformance. Restaurant impairments and disposal losses for fiscal 2024 were related to the decision to close nine locations and the write-off of acquired\nRuth\u2019s Chris assets. Restaurant impairments for fiscal 2023 were primarily related to one underperforming restaurant whose projected cash flows were not\nsufficient to cover its respective carrying values and four restaurant closures. Disposal gains for fiscal 2023 were primarily related to sale of properties, sale-\nleasebacks, disposal of closed locations, and the sale of liquor licenses. Other impacts for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 were primarily related to the write-off of\ninventory from closed locations, right-of-use asset adjustments on early lease terminations and cancelled projects, respectively.\nImpairment charges were measured based on the amount by which the carrying amount of these assets exceeded their fair value. Fair value is generally\ndetermined based on appraisals or sales prices of comparable assets and estimates of discounted future cash flows (see Note 9). These amounts are included in\nimpairments and disposal of assets, net as a component of earnings from continuing operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings.\nNOTE 5 - LAND, BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT, NET\nThe components of land, buildings and equipment, net, are as follows:\n(in millions) May 25, 2025 May 26, 2024\nLand $ 158.8 $ 132.9 \nBuildings 4,328.9 4,034.5 \nEquipment 2,569.6 2,345.4 \nAssets under finance leases 1,490.3 1,252.3 \nConstruction in progress 234.8 179.1 \nTotal land, buildings and equipment $ 8,782.4 $ 7,944.2 \nLess accumulated depreciation and amortization (3,870.3) (3,613.9)\nLess amortization associated with assets under finance leases (196.1) (146.0)\nLand, buildings and equipment, net $ 4,716.0 $ 4,184.3 \nNOTE 6 - SEGMENT INFORMATION\nWe manage our restaurant brands, Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Cheddar\u2019s Scratch Kitchen, Chuy\u2019s, Yard House, Ruth\u2019s Chris, The Capital\nGrille, Seasons 52, Eddie V\u2019s, Bahama Breeze and The Capital Burger in North America as operating segments. The brands operate principally in the U.S.\nwithin full-service dining. We aggregate our operating segments into reportable segments based on a combination of the size, economic characteristics and sub-\nsegment of full-service dining within which each brand operates. We have four reportable segments: (1) Olive Garden, (2) LongHorn Steakhouse, (3) Fine\nDining and (4) Other Business.\nThe Olive Garden segment includes the results of our company-owned Olive Garden restaurants in the U.S. and Canada. The LongHorn Steakhouse\nsegment includes the results of our company-owned LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants in the U.S. The Fine Dining segment aggregates our premium brands\nthat operate within the fine-dining sub-segment of full-service dining and includes the results of our company-owned Ruth\u2019s Chris, The Capital Grille and\nEddie V\u2019s restaurants in the U.S. The Other Business segment aggregates our remaining brands and includes the results of our company-owned Cheddar\u2019s\nScratch Kitchen, Chuy\u2019s, Yard House, Seasons 52, Bahama Breeze and The Capital Burger restaurants in the U.S and ongoing royalties and other fees from our\nfranchise operations and contractually managed locations.\nExternal sales are derived principally from food and beverage sales. We do not rely on any major customers as a source of sales, and the customers and\nlong-lived assets of our reportable segments are predominantly in the U.S. There were no material transactions among reportable segments.\nResources are allocated and performance is assessed by the Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, whom the Company has determined to be\nits Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). Our CODM uses segment profit as the measure for assessing performance of our segments. Segment profit\nincludes revenues and expenses directly attributable to restaurant-level results of operations (sometimes referred to as restaurant-level earnings). Non-cash\nlease-related expenses from our operating segments are recorded to the corporate level as restaurant expenses (which is a component of segment profit) and\ndepreciation and amortization. Additionally, our lease-related right-of-use assets are not managed or evaluated at the operating segment level, but\n63NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nrather at the corporate level.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2025, we changed our reporting of segment profit to exclude pre-opening costs in order to better align with our internal\nreporting and provide a better representation of restaurant-level operating costs. Fiscal 2024 and 2023 figures were recast for comparability.\nThe following tables reconcile our segment results to our consolidated results reported in accordance with GAAP:\n(in millions)\nOlive GardenLongHorn\nSteakhouse Fine DiningOther Business Corporate Consolidated At May 25, 2025 and for the year ended\nSales $ 5,212.9 $ 3,025.5 $ 1,304.8 $ 2,533.5 $ \u2014 $ 12,076.7 \nFood and beverage 1,253.8 1,244.6 414.5 744.1 \u2014 3,657.0 \nRestaurant labor 1,822.1 780.7 367.7 862.6 \u2014 3,833.1 \nRestaurant expenses 846.4 408.2 270.8 504.8 (86.2) 1,944.0 \nMarketing 126.7 9.3 9.3 24.6 \u2014 169.9 \nSegment profit $ 1,163.9 $ 582.7 $ 242.5 $ 397.4 $ 86.2 $ 2,472.7 \nDepreciation and amortization $ 186.0 $ 84.3 $ 70.0 $ 119.0 $ 56.8 $ 516.1 \nImpairments and disposal of assets, net (1.5) \u2014 8.0 42.0 0.7 49.2 \nPre-opening costs 6.5 6.1 3.8 5.4 3.0 24.8 \nSegment assets 2,880.5 2,077.1 2,623.5 3,821.0 1,184.9 12,587.0 \nPurchases of land, buildings and equipment 252.0 144.7 96.3 146.8 4.8 644.6 \n(in millions)\nOlive GardenLongHorn\nSteakhouse Fine DiningOther Business Corporate Consolidated At May 26, 2024 and for the year ended\nSales $ 5,067.0 $ 2,806.2 $ 1,291.5 $ 2,225.3 $ \u2014 $ 11,390.0 \nFood and beverage 1,242.7 1,180.6 425.2 675.4 \u2014 3,523.9 \nRestaurant labor 1,783.1 725.1 351.9 759.2 \u2014 3,619.3 \nRestaurant expenses 812.6 377.3 259.7 433.2 (70.5) 1,812.3 \nMarketing 111.2 6.4 9.7 17.2 \u2014 144.5 \nSegment profit $ 1,117.4 $ 516.8 $ 245.0 $ 340.3 $ 70.5 $ 2,290.0 \nDepreciation and amortization $ 167.7 $ 75.8 $ 65.9 $ 102.5 $ 48.0 $ 459.9 \nImpairments and disposal of assets, net 0.2 0.7 \u2014 \u2014 11.5 12.4 \nPre-opening costs 7.2 5.7 4.0 3.3 4.1 24.3 \nSegment assets 2,862.4 2,025.7 2,596.5 2,901.1 937.3 11,323.0 \nPurchases of land, buildings and equipment 260.7 127.4 118.1 97.9 (2.9) 601.2 \n64NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n(in millions)\nOlive GardenLongHorn\nSteakhouse Fine DiningOther Business Corporate Consolidated At May 28, 2023 and for the year ended\nSales $ 4,877.8 $ 2,612.3 $ 830.8 $ 2,166.9 $ \u2014 $ 10,487.8 \nFood and beverage 1,243.1 1,126.8 290.7 695.3 \u2014 3,355.9 \nRestaurant labor 1,716.8 682.0 217.5 730.0 \u2014 3,346.3 \nRestaurant expenses 788.1 361.4 159.2 422.5 (54.9) 1,676.3 \nMarketing 96.1 5.1 3.6 13.5 \u2014 118.3 \nSegment profit $ 1,033.7 $ 437.0 $ 159.8 $ 305.6 $ 54.9 $ 1,991.0 \nDepreciation and amortization $ 146.5 $ 67.7 $ 35.6 $ 96.8 $ 41.2 $ 387.8 \nImpairments and disposal of assets, net \u2014 (3.3) \u2014 \u2014 (7.3) (10.6)\nPre-opening costs 7.9 6.1 1.3 5.0 5.6 25.9 \nPurchases of land, buildings and equipment 252.5 114.0 57.2 119.6 21.6 564.9 \nFiscal Year Ended\n(in millions) May 25, 2025 May 26, 2024 May 28, 2023\nSegment profit $ 2,472.7 $ 2,290.0 $ 1,991.0 \nLess general and administrative expenses (520.3) (479.2) (386.1)\nLess depreciation and amortization (516.1) (459.9) (387.8)\nLess impairments and disposal of assets, net (49.2) (12.4) 10.6 \nLess pre-opening costs (24.8) (24.3) (25.9)\nLess interest, net (175.1) (138.7) (81.3)\nEarnings before income taxes $ 1,187.2 $ 1,175.5 $ 1,120.5 \nNOTE 7 - DEBT\nThe components of long-term debt are as follows:\n(in millions) May 25, 2025 May 26, 2024\n3.850% senior notes due May 2027 $ 500.0 $ 500.0 \n4.350% senior notes due October 2027 400.0 \u2014 \n4.550% senior notes due October 2029 350.0 \u2014 \n6.300% senior notes due October 2033500.0 500.0 \n6.000% senior notes due August 2035 96.3 96.3 \n6.800% senior notes due October 2037 42.8 42.8 \n4.550% senior notes due February 2048 300.0 300.0 \nTotal long-term debt $ 2,189.1 $ 1,439.1 \nFair value hedge (40.0) (51.8)\nLess unamortized discount and issuance costs (20.2) (16.9)\nTotal long-term debt less unamortized discount and issuance costs $ 2,128.9 $ 1,370.4 \nThe aggregate contractual maturities of long-term debt for each of the five fiscal years subsequent to May 25, 2025, and thereafter are as follows:\n(in millions)\nFiscal Year 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 Thereafter\nDebt repayments $ \u2014 $ 500.0 $ 400.0 $ \u2014 $ 350.0 $ 939.1 \nOn October 23, 2023, we entered into a $1.25 billion Revolving Credit Agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A. (BOA), as\nadministrative agent, and the lenders and other agents party thereto. The Revolving Credit\n65NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nAgreement is a senior unsecured credit commitment to the Company and contains customary representations and affirmative and negative covenants (including\nlimitations on liens and subsidiary debt and a maximum consolidated lease adjusted total debt to total capitalization ratio of 0.75 to 1.00) and events of default\nusual for credit facilities of this type, and consistent with our Prior Revolving Credit Agreement. As of May 25, 2025, we had no outstanding balances under\nthe Revolving Credit Agreement. As of May 25, 2025, $0.2 million of letters of credit were outstanding, which are backed by this facility. After consideration\nof letters of credit backed by the Revolving Credit Agreement, as of May 25, 2025, we had $1.25 billion of credit available under the Revolving Credit\nAgreement.\nLoans under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate of (a) Term SOFR (which is defined, for the applicable interest period, as the Term\nSOFR Screen Rate two U.S. Government Securities Business Days prior to the commencement of such interest period with a term equivalent to such interest\nperiod) plus a Term SOFR adjustment of 0.100 percent plus the relevant margin determined by reference to a ratings-based pricing grid (Applicable Margin), or\n(b) the base rate (which is defined as the highest of the BOA prime rate, the Federal Funds rate plus 0.500 percent, and the Term SOFR plus 1.000 percent) plus\nthe relevant Applicable Margin. Assuming a \u201cBBB\u201d equivalent credit rating level, the Applicable Margin under the Revolving Credit Agreement is 1.000\npercent for Term SOFR loans and 0.000 percent for base rate loans.\nOn September 16, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 1 (Amendment) to the Revolving Credit Agreement, which replaced the prior financial\ncovenant (which provided for a maximum consolidated total debt to total capitalization ratio) with a new financial covenant requiring us to maintain, measured\nas of the end of each fiscal quarter, a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 (which may be temporarily increased to 4.00 to 1.00 upon the\nelection as a result of a covered acquisition, subject to customary limitations set forth in the Revolving Credit Agreement). All other material terms and\nconditions of the Revolving Credit Agreement were unchanged.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement matures on October 23, 2028, and the proceeds may be used for working capital and capital expenditures, the\nrefinancing of certain indebtedness, certain acquisitions and general corporate purposes.\nOn September 16, 2024, we entered into a senior unsecured $600 million 2-year Term Loan Credit Agreement (Term Loan Agreement) with BOA, as\nadministrative agent, the lenders and other agents party thereto, the material terms of which were consistent with the Revolving Credit Agreement. The\nintended use of the proceeds was to finance our acquisition of Chuy\u2019s, and we subsequently terminated the Term Loan Agreement on October 3, 2024, in\nconnection with the closing of our senior notes issuance discussed below. We did not draw any funds and there were never any outstanding borrowings under\nthe Term Loan Agreement.\nOn October 3, 2024, we issued and sold $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.350 percent Senior Notes due 2027 (2027 Notes) and $350\nmillion aggregate principal amount of 4.550 percent Senior Notes due 2029 (2029 Notes and, together with the 2027 Notes, the Notes), pursuant to the\nprovisions of the Underwriting Agreement, dated September 30, 2024, among the Company and BofA Securities, Inc., Truist Securities, Inc., U.S. Bancorp\nInvestments, Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters named therein. The Notes were issued under the Company\u2019s\nIndenture, dated as of January 1, 1996, between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, National Association (as successor to Wells Fargo Bank,\nNational Association, successor to Wells Fargo Bank Minnesota, National Association, formerly known as Norwest Bank Minnesota, National Association), as\ntrustee (Base Trustee), as amended and supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of October 4, 2023, among the Company, the Base\nTrustee and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as a successor trustee with respect to the Notes. We used the proceeds from our issuance of the\nNotes to finance our acquisition of Chuy\u2019s and for general corporate purposes.\nThe 2027 Notes will mature on October 15, 2027, and the 2029 Notes will mature on October 15, 2029. Interest on the Notes will be paid semi-annually\nin arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on April 15, 2025, to holders of record on the preceding March 31 or September 30, as the\ncase may be.\nThe interest rate on our $42.8 million 6.800 percent senior notes due October 2037 is subject to adjustment from time to time if the debt rating assigned to\nsuch series of notes is downgraded below a certain rating level (or subsequently upgraded). The maximum adjustment is 2.000 percent above the initial interest\nrate and the interest rate cannot be reduced below the initial interest rate. As of May 25, 2025, no such adjustments are made to this rate.\nNOTE 8 - DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nWe designate commodity contracts, equity forward contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedging instruments. Our interest rate\nswap agreements are designated as fair value hedges of the related debt. During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we entered into a contract designated as a cash\nflow hedge of the benchmark interest rate on the debt expected to be\n66NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nissued during the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Upon issuance of the debt, we settled this contract which resulted in a $1.9 million loss recorded as a\ncomponent of interest expense due to the immateriality of the loss. Further, we entered into equity forward contracts to hedge the risk of changes in future cash\nflows associated with recognized, employee-directed investments in our common stock within the non-qualified deferred compensation plan. We did not elect\nhedge accounting with the expectation that changes in the fair value of the equity forward contracts would offset changes in the fair value of our common stock\ninvestments in the non-qualified deferred compensation plan.

The major jurisdictions in which the Company files income tax returns include the U.S. federal jurisdiction, Canada,\nand all states in the U.S. that have an income tax. With a few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations by tax\nauthorities for years before fiscal 2024, and state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 2020.\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\n(in millions) May 25, 2025 May 26, 2024\nAccrued liabilities $ 149.8 $ 136.4 \nCompensation and employee benefits 136.2 127.8 \nLease liabilities 1,430.1 1,332.4 \nNet operating loss, credit and charitable contribution carryforwards 84.1 71.8 \nOther \u2014 1.0 \nGross deferred tax assets $ 1,800.2 $ 1,669.4 \nValuation allowance (19.8) (26.8)\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ 1,780.4 $ 1,642.6 \nTrademarks and other acquisition related intangibles (330.1) (274.6)\nBuildings and equipment (409.2) (373.5)\nCapitalized software and other assets (33.3) (30.4)\nLease assets (1,266.1) (1,183.8)\nOther (20.5) (12.3)\nGross deferred tax liabilities $ (2,059.2)$ (1,874.6)\nNet deferred tax liabilities $ (278.8)$ (232.0)\nWe have deferred tax assets of $25.2 million reflecting the benefit of federal credit carryforwards, before valuation allowance, which expire at various\ndates between fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2045. We have deferred tax assets of $58.9 million reflecting the benefit of state net operating loss, credit, and charitable\ncontribution carryforwards, before federal benefit and valuation allowance, which expire at various dates between fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2045.\nWe have taken current and potential future expirations into consideration when evaluating the need for valuation allowances against these deferred tax\nassets. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be\nrealized. Realization is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income or the reversal of deferred tax liabilities during the periods in which those\ntemporary differences become deductible. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning\nstrategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which our\ndeferred tax assets are deductible, we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing\nvaluation allowances at May 25, 2025.\nNOTE 14 - RETIREMENT PLANS\nDefined Benefit Plan and Postretirement Benefit Plan\nWe sponsor an unfunded non-contributory postretirement benefit plan that provides health care benefits to certain eligible salaried retirees as a subsidy\ncredit to a health care reimbursement account. This benefit is not impacted by future changes in health care cost trend rates. As of May 25, 2025 and May 26,\n2024, the benefit obligation was $10.8 million and $12.3 million, respectively. We fund on a pay-as-you go basis with approximately $1.2 million in annual\nfundings.\nWe also sponsor a supplemental defined benefit pension plan, which is an unfunded nonqualified plan separate from our terminated primary pension plan\nwhich was settled in fiscal 2020. The supplemental plan is frozen and therefore no longer accruing benefits for participants. As of May 25, 2025 and May 26,\n2024, the benefit obligation was approximately $3 million and we fund on a pay-as-you-go basis with $0.4 million funded annually.\nDefined Contribution Plan\nWe have a defined contribution (401(k)) plan (Darden Savings Plan) covering most employees age 18 and older. We match contributions for participants\nwith at least one year of service up to 6 percent of compensation, based on our performance. The\n76NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nmatch ranges from a minimum of $0.25 to $1.20 for each dollar contributed by the participant. The Darden Savings Plan also provides for a profit sharing\ncontribution for eligible participants equal to 1.5 percent of the participant\u2019s compensation. Expense recognized in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 was $35.5\nmillion, $45.6 million and $37.7 million, respectively. Employees classified as \u201chighly compensated\u201d under the IRC are not eligible to participate in the Darden\nSavings Plan. Instead, highly compensated employees are eligible to participate in a separate non-qualified deferred compensation (FlexComp) plan. The\nFlexComp plan allows eligible employees to defer the payment of part of their annual salary and all or part of their annual bonus and provides for awards that\napproximate the matching contributions that participants would have received had they been eligible to participate in the Darden Savings Plan, as well as an\nadditional retirement contribution amount. Amounts payable to highly compensated employees under the FlexComp plan totaled $301.9 million and $274.8\nmillion at May 25, 2025 and May 26, 2024, respectively. These amounts are included in other current liabilities on our accompanying consolidated balance\nsheets.\nNOTE 15 - STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nIn September 2015, our shareholders approved the Darden Restaurants, Inc. 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan (2015 Plan). All equity grants subject to FASB\nASC Topic 718 after the date of approval are made under the 2015 Plan. No further equity grants after that date are permitted under the Darden Restaurants,\nInc. 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, the RARE Hospitality International, Inc. Amended and Restated 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan or any other prior stock option\nand/or stock grant plans (collectively, the Prior Plans). The 2015 Plan and the Prior Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of\nDirectors. The 2015 Plan provides for the issuance of up to 10.2 million common shares in connection with the granting of non-qualified stock options,\nrestricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance-based restricted stock units (PRSUs) and other stock-based awards such as Darden stock units to\nemployees, consultants and non-employee directors.

Cash\nreceived from option exercises during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 was $42.8 million, $31.8 million and $24.2 million, respectively. Stock options generally\nvest over 4 years and have a maximum contractual period of 10 years from the date of grant. We settle employee stock option exercises with authorized but\nunissued shares of Darden common stock.\nAs of May 25, 2025, there was $4.5 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options granted under our stock plans. This cost\nis expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years. The total fair value of stock options that vested during fiscal 2025 was $7.5 million.\nRestricted stock and RSUs are granted at a value equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant, and are amortized over their service\nperiods which generally range from one to three years. Restrictions with regard to restricted stock and RSUs lapse at the end of their service periods at which\ntime employees receive unrestricted shares of Darden stock.\nThe following table presents a summary of our RSU activity as of and for the fiscal year ended May 25, 2025:\n  Shares\n(in millions)Weighted-Average\nGrant Date Fair\nValue Per Share\nOutstanding beginning of period 0.26 $132.38\nShares granted 0.08 148.94\nShares vested (0.07) 136.62\nShares canceled (0.01) 158.78\nOutstanding end of period 0.26 $135.67\nAs of May 25, 2025, there was $7.3 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs granted under our stock plans.

Compensation expense is measured based on the\nmarket price of our common stock each period, is amortized over the vesting period and the vested portion is carried as a liability on our accompanying\nconsolidated balance sheets. We also enter into equity forward contracts to hedge the risk of changes in future cash flows associated with the unvested Darden\nstock units granted (see Note 8 for additional information).\nThe following table presents a summary of our Darden stock unit activity as of and for the fiscal year ended May 25, 2025:\n(All units settled in cash)Units\n(in millions)Weighted-Average\nFair Value\nPer Unit\nOutstanding beginning of period 0.76 $147.60\nUnits granted 0.20 145.03\nUnits vested (0.29) 149.87\nUnits canceled (0.03) 139.35\nOutstanding end of period 0.64 $204.02\nAs of May 25, 2025, our total Darden stock unit liability was $83.5 million, including $40.0 million recorded in other current liabilities and $43.5 million\nrecorded in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.

This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years but the amount that vests is ultimately\ndependent on the value of Darden stock at the vesting date. The total fair value of Darden stock units that vested during fiscal 2025 was $42.8 million.\nRelative total shareholder return PRSUs are equity-settled awards that vest over the service period which ranges from three to four years, and the number\nof units that actually vest is determined based on the achievement of performance criteria set forth in the award agreement. The awards vest based on the\nachievement of market-based targets, are measured based on estimated fair value as of the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation, and are amortized over\nthe service period.\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of equity-settled PRSUs and the related assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulation to record stock-based\ncompensation are as follows:\n  Granted in Fiscal Year Ended\nMay 25, 2025 May 26, 2024 May 28, 2023\nDividend yield (1) 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 %\nExpected volatility of stock 26.5 % 32.3 % 55.5 %\nRisk-free interest rate 4.2 % 4.5 % 2.9 %\nExpected option life (in years) 2.9 2.9 2.8\nWeighted-average grant date fair value per unit $ 181.65 $ 217.11 $ 137.73 \n(1)Assumes a reinvestment of dividends.\n79NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\nThe following table presents a summary of our equity-settled PRSU activity as of and for the fiscal year ended May 25, 2025:\nUnits\n(in millions)Weighted-Average\nGrant Date\nFair Value\nPer Unit\nOutstanding beginning of period 0.35 $152.39\nUnits granted 0.11 181.65\nUnits granted/canceled performance impact 0.02 158.40\nUnits vested (0.15) 126.63\nUnits canceled \u2014 \u2014\nOutstanding end of period 0.33 $175.95\nAs of May 25, 2025, there was $9.8 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested equity-settled PRSUs granted under our stock plans.\nThis cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years. The total fair value of equity-settled PRSUs that vested during fiscal 2025\nwas $18.4 million.\nWe maintain an Employee Stock Purchase Plan to provide eligible employees who have completed one year of service (excluding certain employees who\nare employed less than full time or own 5.0 percent or more of our capital stock or that of any subsidiary) an opportunity to invest up to $5.0 thousand per\ncalendar quarter to purchase shares of our common stock, subject to certain limitations.

At May 25, 2025 and May 26, 2024, we had $80.0 million and $79.5 million, respectively, of standby letters of\ncredit related to workers\u2019 compensation and general liabilities accrued in our consolidated financial statements. At May 25, 2025 and May 26, 2024, we had\n$16.7 million and $16.8 million, respectively, of surety bonds related to other payments. Most surety bonds are renewable annually.\nAt May 25, 2025 and May 26, 2024, we had $76.5 million and $71.0 million, respectively, of guarantees associated with leased properties that have been\nassigned to third parties, primarily related to the disposition of Red Lobster in fiscal 2015. These amounts represent the maximum potential amount of future\npayments under the guarantees. The fair value of the maximum potential payments discounted at our weighted-average cost of capital at May 25, 2025 and\nMay 26, 2024, amounted to $61.2 million and $57.7 million, respectively. In the event of default by a third party, the indemnity and default clauses in our\nassignment agreements govern our ability to recover from and pursue the third party for damages incurred as a result of its default. We do not hold any third-\nparty assets as collateral related to these assignment agreements, except to the extent that the assignment allows us to repossess the building and personal\nproperty. At May 25, 2025 and May 26, 2024, the liability recorded for our expected credit losses under these leases was $10.6 million. These guarantees expire\nover their respective lease terms, which range from fiscal 2026 through fiscal 2034.\nWe are subject to private lawsuits, administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. A number of these lawsuits,\nproceedings and claims may exist at any given time. These matters typically involve claims from guests, employees and others related to operational issues\ncommon to the restaurant industry, and can also involve infringement of, or challenges to, our trademarks. While the resolution of a lawsuit, proceeding or\nclaim may have an impact on our financial results for the period in which it is resolved, we believe that the final disposition of the lawsuits, proceedings and\nclaims in which we are currently involved, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of\noperations or liquidity.\nNOTE 17 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn June 18, 2025, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $1.50 per share to be paid August 1, 2025 to all shareholders of record as of the\nclose of business on July 10, 2025.\n80Item 9.CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nThere were no changes in or disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure requiring disclosure under this Item.\nItem 9A.

(the \u201cCompany\u201d) is a public company with stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange and as a result, the Company\nis subject to federal and state securities laws, including Rule 10b-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\u201cExchange Act\u201d),\nwhich prohibit \u201cinsider trading\u201d in the Company\u2019s securities. Insider trading violations are pursued vigorously by the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and the New York Stock Exchange and are punished severely. Securities laws impose liability for violations not only on the\nindividuals who trade in the Company\u2019s securities, or who tip material nonpublic information (\u201cmaterial nonpublic information\u201d) to others who\ntrade, but also on the Company itself and its \u201ccontrolling persons\u201d if they fail to take reasonable steps to prevent insider trading by Company\npersonnel.\nEach individual is responsible for knowing the laws and regulations that apply to his or her transactions in the Company\u2019s securities. The\nCompany has adopted this Insider Trading Policy Statement (the \u201cPolicy Statement\u201d) both to satisfy its obligation to prevent insider trading and to\nhelp Company personnel avoid the severe consequences associated with violations of the insider trading laws. This Policy Statement also is\nintended to prevent even the appearance of improper conduct on the part of anyone employed by or associated with the Company. A violation of\nlaw, or even an SEC investigation that does not result in prosecution, can tarnish a reputation and irreparably damage a career. The Company\u2019s\nreputation for integrity and ethical conduct is well known and has been built over many years. We must all be diligent to protect that reputation\n\u201cnow and for generations.\u201d\nTHE CONSEQUENCES\nAs an officer, employee or member of the Board of Directors of the Company, you are responsible for complying with federal and state securities\nlaws and this Policy Statement. The consequences of failure to do so can be severe.\nA. Traders and Tippers\nCompany personnel who trade on inside information (or their \u201ctippees\u201d who trade after receiving information from them) are\nsubject to severe penalties:\n1. A civil penalty of up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided;\n2. A criminal fine of up to $5,000,000 (no matter how small the profit); and\n3. A jail term of up to twenty years.\nAn employee who tips information to a person who then trades is subject to the same penalties as the tippee, even if the\nemployee did not trade and did not profit from the tippee\u2019s trading.\nB. Control Persons\nThe Company and its directors, officers and supervisory personnel, if they fail to take appropriate steps to prevent illegal insider\ntrading, are also potentially subject to substantial civil and, in the case of the Company, criminal penalties.C. Company-Imposed Sanctions\nViolation of this Policy Statement may result in Company-imposed sanctions, including termination of employment, whether or\nnot the employee's failure to comply is a violation of law.\nSTATEMENT OF INSIDER TRADING POLICY\nThis Policy Statement applies to every officer and employee of the Company and every member of its Board of Directors, and any advisor and\nconsultant to the Company, who is aware of material nonpublic information relating to the Company (\u201cInsiders\u201d). No Insider may, either directly or\nindirectly (including, without limitation, through Family Members (defined below), friends or entities controlled or influenced by such persons), (a)\nbuy, sell or otherwise dispose of Company securities, including via bona fide gifts and charitable contributions, (other than under a pre-approved\ntrading plan that complies with SEC Rule 10b5-1, described below) while in possession of material nonpublic information, or engage in any other\naction to take personal advantage of that information, or (b) disclose that information to persons within the Company whose job do not require\nthem to have that information, or outside of the Company to other persons. All consultants and outside advisors assisting the Company on\nsensitive matters are expected to abide by this Policy Statement.\nIn addition, no Insider who, in the course of working for the Company, learns of material nonpublic information about a company with which the\nCompany does business (including a customer or supplier of the Company) may trade in that company's securities until the information becomes\npublic or is no longer material.\nSmall transactions, or ones that may seem necessary or justifiable for independent reasons (such as the need to raise money for a personal\nemergency), are not exceptions to these policies. The securities laws do not recognize such exceptions, and we want to avoid even the\nappearance of an improper transaction to preserve the Company's reputation for adhering to the highest standards of conduct.\nFor purposes of this Policy Statement, references to \u201ctrading\u201d in Company \u201csecurities\u201d includes purchases and sales of Company stocks, bonds,\nnotes, options, puts, calls, and other securities that the Company may issue, and also includes sales of stock acquired by exercising employee\nstock options, and other trades made by giving investment direction under the Company\u2019s employee benefit plans, as described below.\nIf you are unsure whether or not a particular transaction is prohibited by this Policy Statement, you should consult with the General Counsel prior\nto engaging in, or entering into, an agreement, understanding or arrangement to engage in, such transaction. The General Counsel or his or her\ndesignee shall be responsible for the administration of this Policy Statement.\n    A.    Disclosure of Information to Others\nCommunication with certain categories of persons in the financial markets must be aligned with the Company\u2019s Policy Statement\nRP-14 \u201cDissemination of Company Information.\u201d These communications must only be held through the Chair of the Board of\nDirectors, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and other persons who may, from time to time, be designated\nby the Chief Executive Officer to disclose material information (as defined below) and to speak on behalf of Darden. If you are\nasked by the media, shareholders (internal or external), market analysts, or other stakeholders to speak or write on behalf of the\nCompany regarding such information, you must decline to comment and refer them to an authorized person as described in RP-\n14. You should become familiar with the procedures described in RP-14 and should not disclose information to anyone outside\nthe Company, including Family Members, friends, vendors\n2or suppliers, other than in accordance with those procedures. You also must not discuss material nonpublic information\nconcerning the Company or its business in any internet-based forum, application or social networking website.\nOtherwise, in your daily work communications, behave as if you are an ambassador of the Company. Each employee should be\ncommitted to preserving and enhancing the Company\u2019s reputation and must not disclose any confidential or proprietary\ninformation or trade secrets to anyone, except as specifically authorized by management through Company policy, or when\ndisclosure is required by law. Any communications inconsistent with Company policy could cause damage to the Company and\nshould be avoided. This Policy Statement and related RP-14 are not intended to restrict necessary internal business\ncommunications with other employees on a \u201cneed to know\u201d basis where you have a reason to expect that the other employee\nwill not trade while in possession of the information.\nB.    \u201cMaterial\u201d Information\nAs a general rule, information about the Company is material if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would\nconsider it important in making a decision to buy, hold, or sell securities, or that significantly alters the total mix of information\npublicly available about the Company. Any information that could be expected to affect the Company's stock price, whether it is\npositive or negative, should be considered material. While it is not possible to identify in advance all information that will be\ndeemed to be material, some examples of information that ordinarily would be regarded as material are:\n1. Undisclosed quarterly earnings or monthly same-restaurant sales results that are inconsistent with the consensus\nexpectations of the investment community;\n2. Projections of future earnings or losses, or other earnings guidance;\n3. Other significant financial projections, strategic plans, forecasts or budgets, including plans concerning significant\nrestaurant openings and closings and any related asset impairment charges;\n4. A pending or proposed merger, reorganization, tender offer or joint venture;\n5. A pending or proposed acquisition or disposition of a significant asset;\n6. A change in control of the Company;\n7. Events involving the Company\u2019s debt or equity securities, such as repurchases of common stock, a change in dividend\npolicy, the declaration of a stock split, a change in the Company\u2019s debt rating, or an offering of additional securities;\n8. A change in management, including members of the Board of Directors or senior executive officers;\n9. Changes in auditors or an auditor notification that the Company may no longer rely on the auditor\u2019s reports;\n10. Significant legal proceedings or regulatory matters, whether actual, pending or threatened, or the resolution of those\nproceedings or matters;\n311. Development of a significant new product or process, including a new restaurant concept;\n12. Impending bankruptcy or the existence of severe liquidity problems;\n13. The gain or loss of a significant customer or supplier;\n14. News about a major contract award or cancellation of an existing contract;\n15. Significant price changes on major food products;\n16. The occurrence of a material cybersecurity breach or data privacy failure;\n17. Information about significant misstatements or omissions in the Company\u2019s disclosure documents, whether intentional or\ninadvertent; and\n18. Actual or projected changes in industry circumstances or competitive conditions that could significantly affect the\nCompany\u2019s revenues, earnings, financial position or future projections.\nThere is no \u201cbright-line\u201d test to determine if information is \u201cmaterial.\u201d The critical test is whether a reasonable investor would\nconsider the information important in making an investment decision. In general, any significant information or event outside the\nCompany\u2019s normal course of business should be considered carefully to determine if it is material. This may require difficult\njudgments about facts and circumstances of particular cases. When in doubt, the information should be presumed to be\nmaterial. If you have questions regarding specific information, please contact the General Counsel.\nAn area of particular concern that may require difficult judgments regarding materiality involves the Company\u2019s quarterly\nearnings and sales results. Certain employees may possess this information through their particular job duties, or as a result of\nreceiving weekly or monthly margin reports, market intelligence reports providing details about industry results or other\nCompany financial reports. Possession of Company-wide sales and earnings data that is inconsistent with the consensus\nexpectations of the investment community could clearly be material. There are also times when information about just one of the\nCompany\u2019s several restaurant concepts would be material. For example, if the earnings or sales data about one of the\nCompany\u2019s larger concepts indicates that its results are notably better or worse than the investment community is expecting,\nthat concept\u2019s results could impact the Company\u2019s overall results and be material. If you possess nonpublic earnings or sales\ndata and you are unsure whether the information is material, you should refrain from trading in Company securities until after\nthat information is made public or contact the General Counsel to discuss the situation prior to trading.\nC.    Twenty-Twenty Hindsight\nRemember, anyone looking closely at your securities transactions will be doing so after the fact, with the benefit of hindsight. As\na practical matter, before engaging in any transaction, you should carefully consider how the Company, enforcement authorities\nand others might view the transaction in hindsight.\nD.    When Information is \u201cPublic\u201d\nIf you are aware of material nonpublic information, you may not trade until the information has been disclosed by the Company\nor third parties broadly to the public (such as by\n4press release or other authorized public statement, including any filing with the SEC) and the investing public has had time to\nabsorb the information fully. As a general rule, we assume that information is absorbed by the markets by the end of the second\nbusiness day after the announcement of that information. If, for example, the Company announces its earnings at 7:00 a.m. on a\nThursday, you should not trade in the Company's securities before the market opens on the following Monday. Although\ntechnological advances have increased the speed at which investors have access to information, we believe it is prudent to wait\ntwo full business days before allowing trading to begin.\nE.    Transactions by Family Members\nThis Policy Statement applies to family members who reside with you, anyone else who resides in your household, and any\nfamily members who do not live in your household but whose transactions in Company securities are directed by you or are\nsubject to your influence or control (such as parents or adult children who consult with you before they trade in Company\nsecurities) (\u201cFamily Members\u201d). You are responsible for the transactions of Family Members and therefore should make them\naware of the need to confer with you before they trade in the Company's securities, and you should treat all such transactions\nfor the purpose of this Policy Statement and applicable securities law as if the transaction were for your own account.\nTRANSACTIONS UNDER COMPANY PLANS\nA.    Stock Option Exercises\nThis Policy Statement does not apply to the exercise of an employee stock option where cash is paid separately for the exercise\nprice of the option, or to the portion of the exercise of a tax withholding right under which the Company withholds shares subject\nto an option to satisfy tax withholding requirements. This Policy Statement does apply, however, to any sale of stock in\nconnection with the exercise of an option, including as part of a broker-assisted cashless exercise of an option, or any other\nmarket sale for the purpose of generating the cash needed to pay the exercise price of an option or the required tax withholding.\nSince most employees typically use the cashless exercise approach for exercising employee stock options, they may not\nexercise an option and sell the resulting shares at any time they possess material nonpublic information.\nB.    Darden Savings Plan and FlexComp\nThis Policy Statement applies to some (but not all) transactions in the Company stock fund in the Darden Savings Plan\n(including the 401(k) plan and the Employee Stock Ownership Plan) and the phantom Company stock fund in the FlexComp\nPlan (collectively, the \u201cCompany Stock Funds\u201d). This Policy Statement does not apply to a u t o m a t i c periodic purchases of stock\nor phantom stock in the Company Stock Funds through payroll deduction. This Policy Statement does apply, however, to\nv o l u n t a r y elections you make involving the Company Stock Funds, including: (a) your initial election to enroll in the plans, if you\nwill be making contributions to the Company Stock Fund, (b) an election to increase or decrease the percentage of your periodic\ncontributions that will be allocated to the Company Stock Funds, (c) an election to make an intra-plan transfer of an existing\naccount balance into or out of the Company Stock Funds, (d) an election to borrow money against your plan account if the loan\nwill result in a liquidation of some or all of your Company Stock Fund balance, and (e) an election to pre-pay a plan loan if the\npre-payment will result in allocation of loan proceeds to the Company Stock Fund. None of these actions should be taken when\nyou possess material nonpublic information.\n5C.    Market Timing in the Company Stock Funds in Savings Plan or FlexComp\nMarket timing, or frequent short-term trading of mutual fund shares, is viewed negatively by securities regulators and\nshareholder advocacy groups. Some investors have used their employee 401(k) plans or deferred compensation plans like\nFlexComp to engage in market timing. Market timing by even a small number of plan participants can be harmful to the other\nplan participants \u2013 even when it does not violate the law \u2013 by driving up the costs of administering the fund. In addition, market\ntiming by employees in-and-out of the Company Stock Funds, particularly near the Company\u2019s scheduled release of financial\nresults, can suggest that the trades were made using material nonpublic information, even when this is not the case. The SEC\nand other regulators have taken steps to stop market timing practices and punish people who have broken the insider trading\nlaws through market timing. In light of this close scrutiny, frequent and excessive trading in the Company Stock Funds is\nprohibited, and short-term trading in-and-out of the Company Stock Funds, especially during periods surrounding the\nCompany\u2019s scheduled release of financial results, is strongly discouraged. The Company reserves the right to investigate\nwhether market timing is taking place in the Company Stock Funds or in other plan funds, and could impose greater restrictions\nto deter these practices. In addition, all executive officers and members of the Board of Directors of the Company who file\nreports with the SEC under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act (\u201cSection 16 Filers\u201d) must abide by SEC rules that prohibit\nnon-exempt opposite way transactions in the Company Stock Funds within any six-month period, and must report all plan\ntransactions involving Company stock or phantom stock on Form 4 or 5, as applicable.\nD. Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nThis Policy Statement does not apply to a u t o m a t i c periodic purchases through payroll deduction of Company stock in the\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d). This Policy Statement does apply, however, to voluntary transactions, including your:\n(a) initial election to enroll in the ESPP for any enrollment period, (b) election to increase or decrease the amount of your\nautomatic periodic contributions by payroll deduction to the ESPP, (c) election to cease payroll deductions altogether and\nwithdraw any accumulated cash, and (d) sales of Company stock that were purchased under the ESPP, none of which should\nbe done when you possess material nonpublic information (and, for Designated Insiders (defined below), should not be\nconducted during any Blackout Period as discussed below). If you participate in the ESPP, and you do not possess material\nnonpublic information at the time you enroll, then all subsequent automatic investments by payroll deduction are allowed without\nrestriction under this Policy Statement.\nE. Dividend Reinvestment Plan\nThis Policy Statement does not apply to purchases of Company stock resulting from the automatic reinvestment of dividends\npaid on Company stock held in the Company's Direct Advantage Investment Program (\u201cDividend Reinvestment Plan\u201d). This\nPolicy Statement does apply, however, to voluntary purchases of Company stock under the Dividend Reinvestment Plan\nresulting from your initial election to participate in the plan, to make additional contributions, or to increase your level of\nparticipation. This Policy Statement also applies to your voluntary sale of any Company stock held in the plan.\n6SPECIAL AND PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS\nNo officer, employee or member of the Board of Directors of the Company should engage in short-term or speculative\ntransactions in the Company's securities. Other transactions, such as limit orders, may raise special issues because of the\nmanner in which they are executed. You should observe the special rules described below regarding the following types of\ntransactions:\nA.    Short Sales\nShort sales are sales of securities which the seller does not own at the time the sell order is placed. Short sales would generally\nbe interpreted by the market as an expectation by the seller that the securities will decline in value, and therefore that the seller\nhas no confidence in the Company or its short-term prospects. In addition, short sales by an Insider may reduce the employee\u2019s\nincentive to improve the Company's performance. For these reasons, short sales of the Company\u2019s securities are prohibited. In\naddition, short sales by Company executive officers and members of its Board of Directors would violate Section 16(c) of the\nExchange Act.\nB.    Publicly Traded Options\nA transaction in publicly traded options is, in effect, a bet on the short-term movement of the stock and therefore, if made by an\nInsider, creates the appearance that the trading is based on material nonpublic information. Transactions in publicly-traded\noptions also may focus the Insider\u2019s attention on short-term performance at the expense of the Company's long-term objectives.\nAccordingly, transactions in puts, calls or other derivative securities based on the Company\u2019s securities on an exchange or in\nany other organized market are prohibited. (Option positions arising from certain types of hedging transactions are governed by\nthe section below captioned \u201cHedging Transactions.\u201d)\nC.    Hedging Transactions\nCertain forms of hedging or monetization transactions, such as zero-cost collars and forward sale contracts, allow an Insider to\nlock in much of the value of his or her stock holdings, often in exchange for all or part of the potential for upside appreciation in\nthe stock. These transactions allow an Insider to continue to own the covered securities, but without the full risks and rewards of\nownership. When that occurs, the Insider may no longer have the same objectives as the Company's other shareholders.\nTherefore, Insiders are prohibited from engaging in any such transactions.\nD.    Margin Accounts and Pledged Securities\nSecurities held in a margin account as collateral for margin loan may be sold by the broker without the customer's consent if the\ncustomer fails to meet a margin call. Similarly, securities pledged as collateral for a loan may be sold in foreclosure if the\nborrower defaults on the loan. Because a margin sale or foreclosure sale may occur at a time when the pledgor is aware of\nmaterial nonpublic information or otherwise is not permitted to trade in Company securities, Insiders are prohibited from holding\nCompany\u2019s securities in a margin account or otherwise pledging Company securities as collateral.\nE.    Limit Orders\nA limit order is an order placed with a broker to buy or sell a security at a specific price or better. The broker will execute the\ntrade only within the price restriction. For example, if the client places a limit order to sell stock at $33 when the price is at $31,\nthe trade will\n7not be executed unless and until the stock price hits $33. The Company discourages placing limit orders on the Company\u2019s\nstock, because the orders can result in an automatic trade on a later date when the price is reached, regardless of whether the\nperson placing the order possesses material nonpublic information at that time. If you feel you must use a limit order, it should\nbe limited to a relatively short time, usually no more than a week. In addition, Designated Insiders should limit the duration of\nany limit order to a Window Period, and may not execute any transactions in Company securities, including pursuant to a\npreviously placed limit order, during a Blackout Period.\nBLACKOUT AND WINDOW PERIODS FOR TRADING BY DESIGNATED INSIDERS\nA.    Quarterly Blackout and Window Periods\nTo help prevent inadvertent violations of the securities laws and to avoid even the appearance of trading on material nonpublic\ninformation, the General Counsel will maintain a list of \u201cDesignated Insiders,\u201d which shall consist of: (i) members of the\nCompany\u2019s Board of Directors, (ii) all Company employees at the level of senior vice president or above, (iii) employees on the\ndistribution list for the Company\u2019s Disclosure Committee (who review the Company\u2019s SEC reports), and (iv) such other persons\nas the General Counsel may designate from time to time. In addition to being subject to all the other limitations of this Policy\nStatement, Designated Insiders and their Family Members and entities controlled or influenced by such persons may not\nconduct any transactions involving the Company\u2019s securities covered by this Policy Statement during a \u201cBlackout Period\u201d\nbeginning three weeks prior to the end of each fiscal quarter and ending two full business days following the regularly scheduled\nfinal public release of the Company\u2019s earnings results for that quarter or the full year. In other words, Designated Insiders may\nonly conduct transactions in Company securities during the \u201cWindow Period\u201d beginning two full business days following the\nregularly scheduled final public release of the Company\u2019s quarterly earnings and ending three weeks prior to the close of the\nnext fiscal quarter, and only then if they are comfortable that they do not otherwise possess any material nonpublic information\nconcerning Darden. At present, the Company\u2019s fiscal quarters generally end on the last Sunday in February, May, August and\nNovember, and the final earnings results for the quarters usually (but not always) are announced at 7:00 a.m. on a business day\nduring the third full week in March, June, September and December. The exact dates of the Blackout and Window Periods for\neach fiscal year will be posted on the Company\u2019s intranet for reference by any Designated Insider and updated from time to\ntime.\nUnder certain very limited circumstances, a Designated Insider may be permitted to trade during a Blackout Period, but only if\nthe General Counsel concludes that the Designated Insider does not in fact possess material nonpublic information (because,\nfor example, he or she is out on vacation and has not received any earnings or sales reports). Designated Insiders wishing to\ntrade during a Blackout Period must contact the General Counsel for approval at least two business days in advance of any\nproposed transaction involving the Company\u2019s securities. All determinations by the General Counsel shall be final and not\nsubject to further review.\nB.    Event-Specific Trading Restriction Periods\nFrom time to time, material nonpublic facts and circumstances might lead the General Counsel to conclude that some or all\nCompany employees should be restricted from trading in Company securities. In that event, the General Counsel may notify\ncertain or all Designated Insiders that they should not trade in the Company\u2019s securities, potentially without disclosing the reason\nfor the restriction. The existence of an event-specific trading\n8restriction period or extension of a Blackout Period for Designated Insiders will not be announced to the Company as a whole and\nshould not be communicated to any other person. Even if the General Counsel has not designated you as a person who should\nnot trade due to an event-specific restriction, you should not trade while aware of material nonpublic information. Exceptions\ncannot be granted during an event-specific trading restriction period.\nPRE-CLEARANCE PROCEDURES\nTo further prevent even the appearance of trading on material nonpublic information, and to facilitate the filing of required SEC reports, Section\n16 Filers and their Family Members and entities controlled or influenced by such persons may not engage in any transaction in the Company\u2019s\nsecurities (including a gift, contribution to a trust, or similar transfer) without first obtaining pre-clearance of the transaction from the General\nCounsel or his or her designee, regardless of whether or not a Blackout Period is in effect. A request for pre-clearance should be submitted to\nthe General Counsel at least two days in advance of the proposed transaction. Section 16 Filers may request pre-clearance by contacting the\nGeneral Counsel by email, or in person or by phone.\nIn evaluating each proposed transaction, the General Counsel or his or her designee will consult as necessary with senior management and\noutside counsel before clearing any proposed trade. Clearance of a transaction is generally valid only through the end of the calendar week\nduring which the Section 16 Filer is granted such clearance. The General Counsel is under no obligation to approve a transaction submitted for\npre-clearance. If clearance is denied, the fact of such denial must be kept confidential by the person requesting such clearance. Section 16\nFilers do not need to receive pre-clearance for transactions pursuant to an approved Rule 10b5-1 plan but must receive prior approval before\nimplementing such a plan by the General Counsel or his or her designee.\nWhen a request for pre-clearance is made, the Section 16 Filer should consider whether they may have any material nonpublic information\nabout the Company and should mention those circumstances. They should indicate whether they have effected any non-exempt \u201copposite-way\u201d\ntransactions within the past six months and should be prepared to report their proposed transaction on an appropriate Form 4 or Form 5. They\nshould also be prepared to comply with SEC Rule 144 and file Form 144 in advance of any sale. Further information concerning the Section 16\nand Rule 144 reporting requirements is provided in a memorandum titled \u201cSection 16 and Rule 144 Compliance\u201d that is provided by the\nCompany to all persons required to make Section 16 filings, additional copies of which are available upon request from the General Counsel.\nThe pre-clearance policy does not apply to a stock option exercise if the option is to be exercised and no shares are to be sold, but it does apply\nto sales of stock issued upon the exercise of stock options, including same-day sales and cashless exercises. See \u201cStock Option Exercises\u201d\nabove.\nPREARRANGED TRADING PLANS\nSEC Rule 10b5-1 provides a defense from insider trading liability if trades occur under a pre-arranged \u201ctrading plan\u201d that meets certain\nconditions. Under this rule, if you enter into a binding contract, instruction or written plan that specifies the amount, price and date on which\nsecurities are to be purchased, sold or otherwise disposed of, including by gift or charitable contribution, or a pre-determined formula by which\nthe amount, price and date of transactions will be determined, and these arrangements are established at a time when you do not possess\nmaterial nonpublic information, then you may claim a defense to insider trading liability if the transactions under the trading plan occur at a time\nwhen you have subsequently learned material nonpublic information. Other conditions of the rule include mandatory \u201ccooling off\u201d periods and a\nprohibition on maintaining multiple overlapping plans. Any Designated Insider who wishes to implement a trading plan under SEC Rule 10b5-1\nmust first pre-clear the plan with the General Counsel or his or her designee. Transactions that comply with a pre-cleared trading plan will not\n9require further pre-clearance at the time of the transaction, but Section 16 Filers are required to advise the General Counsel immediately upon\nthe execution of a transaction so that appropriate SEC filings can be made timely.\nPOST-TERMINATION TRANSACTIONS\nThis Policy Statement continues to apply to your transactions in Company securities even after you have terminated employment. If you are\naware of material nonpublic information when you terminate service as a member of the Board of Directors, officer or other employee of the\nCompany, you may not trade in the Company\u2019s securities until that information has become public or is no longer material. The pre-clearance\nprocedures for Section 16 Filers as discussed above, however, will cease to apply to transactions in Company securities upon the expiration of\nany Blackout Period or other event-specific trading restriction periods that is applicable at the time of termination of service.\nPERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND COMPANY ASSISTANCE\nQuestions about this Policy Statement or its application to any proposed transaction should be directed to the General Counsel. Ultimately,\nhowever, the responsibility for adhering to this Policy Statement and avoiding unlawful transactions rests with the individual Insider.\nCOMPLIANCE\nAny employee must promptly report, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Darden\u2019s Code of Conduct (including through the use of the\nCompany\u2019s hotlines described in the Code of Conduct), any trading in Company securities by any Insiders, or any disclosure of material\nnonpublic information concerning the Company or other companies by such Insiders, that such person has reason to believe may violate this\nPolicy Statement or federal or state securities laws.\nAFFIRMATION\nDarden\u2019s Code of Conduct includes a section on insider trading and references this Policy Statement. The Company conducts annual Code of\nConduct recommitment training for employees subject to the recommitment training requirement. This Policy Statement will be affirmatively\nprovided to employees who become Designated Insiders.\nAmended and Restated 5/21/2002\nAmended 7/21/2003\nAmended 5/6/2004\nAmended 11/27/2007\nAmended 5/1/2008\nAmended 4/10/2009\nAmended 6/23/2010\nAmended 1/1/2012\nAmended 3/27/2012\nAmended 3/28/2012\nAmended 4/30/2014\nAmended 11/11/2014\nAmended 3/18/2015\nAmended 12/14/2017\nAmended 6/18/2019\nAmended 10/01/2021\nAmended 07/10/2024\n10EXHIBIT  21\nSUBSIDIARIES OF DARDEN RESTAURANTS, INC.\nAs of May 25, 2025, we had five \u201csignificant subsidiaries\u201d, as defined in Regulation S-X, Rule 1-02(w), identified as follows:\n1.

(the \u201cCompany\u201d) believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its\nshareholders to create and maintain a culture that emphasizes integrity and accountability and that reinforces the Company\u2019s pay-for-\nperformance compensation philosophy. The Board has therefore adopted this Incentive Compensation Clawback Policy (this \u201cPolicy\u201d), which\nprovides for the recoupment of certain executive compensation in the event of a restatement of the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nThe Compensation Committee (the \u201cCommittee\u201d) of the Board shall have full authority to administer, interpret and enforce this Policy in\naccordance with its business judgment, and any determinations made by the Committee shall be final, conclusive and binding on all interested\nparties. However, the independent members of the Board shall administer, interpret and enforce this Policy with respect to the Chief Executive\nOfficer and any other Executive Officer who is also a member of the Board, and references in this Policy to \u201cthe Committee\u201d shall be deemed to\nbe references to the independent members of the Board with respect to such individuals.\nCOVERED EMPLOYEES\nThis Policy applies to current and former Executive Officers of the Company. \u201cExecutive Officer\u201d means any person who is or was designated by\nthe Board as an \u201cofficer\u201d of the Company as defined in Rule 16a-1 for purposes of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d).\nThis Policy shall be binding and enforceable against Executive Officers and their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal\nrepresentatives. The Committee may require that any employment agreement, equity award agreement or similar agreement shall, as a\ncondition to the grant of any benefit thereunder, require an Executive Officer to agree to abide by the terms of this Policy, even after such\nExecutive Officer is no longer employed by the Company.\nINCENTIVE COMPENSATION\nFor purposes of this Policy, \u201cIncentive Compensation\u201d means any compensation, including performance bonuses and long-term incentive awards\n(in each case, including cash, performance stock units or other stock-based awards), paid, granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part on\nthe attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure. \u201cFinancial Reporting Measure\u201d means a measure that is determined and presented in\naccordance with the accounting principles used in preparing the Company\u2019s financial statements, and any measure that is derived wholly or in\npart from such measures. Stock price and total shareholder return (and any measures that are derived wholly or in part from stock price or total\nshareholder return) shall, for purposes of this Policy, be considered Financial Reporting Measures. For the avoidance of doubt, Incentive\nCompensation does not include any bonuses or long-term incentive awards paid, granted, earned or vested based solely on continued\nemployment through one or more specified dates or otherwise solely time-based, such as stock options or restricted stock units that vest solely\non the basis of the passage of time.\nCLAWBACK AND FORFEITURE UPON FINANCIAL RESTATEMENT\nA.Notwithstanding the provisions of any compensation or incentive plan, policy or practice, or any award agreement or similar document\nrelating to a specific grant or award of IncentiveCompensation, for an individual who is or was an Executive Officer at any time on or after the date on which a grant or award of\nIncentive Compensation is made, in the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Company will require the Executive Officer to, and the\nExecutive Officer shall immediately upon a demand therefor, repay to the Company any and all Erroneously Awarded Compensation\nReceived in accordance with applicable New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) rules and Rule 10D-1 under the Exchange Act as follows:\n(1)After an Accounting Restatement, the Committee shall determine the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received\nby each Executive Officer and shall promptly notify each Executive Officer of the amount of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation\nand demand the repayment or return of such Erroneously Awarded Compensation, as applicable. Recovery under this Policy with\nrespect to an Executive Officer shall not require the finding of any misconduct by such Executive Officer or such Executive Officer\nbeing found responsible for any accounting error leading to an Accounting Restatement.\n(2)For Incentive Compensation based on (or derived from) the Company\u2019s stock price or total shareholder return, where the amount of\nErroneously Awarded Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation directly from the information in the applicable\nAccounting Restatement, the amount to be repaid or returned shall be determined by the Committee based on a reasonable\nestimate of the effect of the Accounting Restatement on the Company\u2019s stock price or total shareholder return upon which the\nIncentive Compensation was Received. The Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of any such reasonable\nestimate and provide the relevant documentation as required to the NYSE.\n(3)Subject to the requirement that recovery be made reasonably promptly, the Committee shall have sole discretion to determine the\nappropriate means of recovering Erroneously Awarded Compensation based on the particular facts and circumstances, which\nmeans of recovery may vary, without limitation, between Executive Officers or based on the nature of the applicable Incentive\nCompensation. To the extent that the Executive Officer has already reimbursed the Company for any Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation Received under any duplicative recovery obligations established by the Company or applicable law, any such\nreimbursed amount shall be credited to the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation that is subject to recovery under this\nPolicy.\n(4)To the extent that an Executive Officer fails to repay all Erroneously Awarded Compensation to the Company when due, the\nCompany shall take all actions reasonable and appropriate to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation from the applicable\nExecutive Officer. Without limiting the generality of the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall have the right to sue for\nrepayment and enforce the Executive Officer\u2019s obligation to repay through the reduction or cancellation of outstanding and future\nincentive compensation. The applicable Executive Officer shall be required to reimburse the Company for any and all expenses\nreasonably incurred (including legal fees) by the Company in recovering such Erroneously Awarded Compensation in accordance\nwith the immediately preceding sentence.\nB.Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to take the actions contemplated by Section A above\nif the Committee determines that recovery would be impracticable and either of the following conditions is met:\n(1)The Committee has determined that the direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the\namount to be recovered. Before making this determination, the Company must make a reasonable attempt to recover the\nErroneously Awarded Compensation, document such attempt and provide such documentation to the NYSE.(2)Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of\nthe Company, to fail to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended, and regulations thereunder.\nC.The Company shall not be permitted to insure or indemnify any Executive Officer against (i) the loss of any Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation that is repaid, returned or recovered pursuant to the terms of this Policy, or (ii) any claims relating to the Company\u2019s\nenforcement of its rights under this Policy. Further, the Company shall not enter into any agreement that exempts any Incentive\nCompensation that is granted, paid or awarded to an Executive Officer from the application of this Policy or that waives the Company\u2019s\nright to recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, and this Policy shall supersede any such agreement (whether entered into\nbefore, on or after the effective date of this Policy).\nADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS\nFor purposes of this Policy, the following capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth below.\nA.\u201cAccounting Restatement\u201d means an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any financial\nreporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to correct an error in previously issued\nfinancial statements that is material to the previously issued financial statements (a \u201cBig R\u201d restatement), or that would result in a\nmaterial misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period (a \u201clittle r\u201d restatement).\nB.\u201cClawback Eligible Incentive Compensation\u201d means all Incentive Compensation Received by an Executive Officer (i) on or after October\n2, 2023, (ii) after beginning service as an Executive Officer, (iii) who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the applicable\nperformance period relating to any Incentive Compensation (whether or not such Executive Officer is serving at the time the Erroneously\nAwarded Compensation is required to be repaid to the Company), (iv) while the Company has a class of securities listed on a national\nsecurities exchange or a national securities association, and (v) during the applicable Clawback Period (as defined below).\nC.\u201cClawback Period\u201d means, with respect to any Accounting Restatement, the three completed fiscal years of the Company immediately\npreceding the Restatement Date (as defined below), and if the Company changes its fiscal year, any transition period of less than nine\nmonths within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years.\nD.\u201cErroneously Awarded Compensation\u201d means, with respect to each Executive Officer in connection with an Accounting Restatement, the\namount of Clawback Eligible Incentive Compensation that exceeds the amount of Incentive Compensation that otherwise would have\nbeen Received had it been determined based on the restated amounts, computed without regard to any taxes paid.\nE.\u201cReceived\u201d means, with respect to any Incentive Compensation, actual or deemed receipt, and Incentive Compensation shall be\ndeemed received in the Company\u2019s fiscal period during which the Financial Reporting Measure specified in the Incentive Compensation\naward is attained, even if the payment or grant of the Incentive Compensation to the Executive Officer occurs after the end of that\nperiod.\nF.\u201cRestatement Date\u201d means the earlier to occur of (i) the date the Board, a committee of the Board or the officers of the Company\nauthorized to take such action if Board action is not required, concludes, or reasonably should have concluded, that the Company is\nrequired to prepare an Accounting Restatement, or (ii) the date a court, regulator or other legally authorized body directs the Company to\nprepare an Accounting Restatement.AMENDMENT\nThis Policy may be amended by the Board from time to time in its discretion.\nNON-EXCLUSIVITY\nNothing in this Policy shall be viewed as limiting the right of the Company or the Committee to pursue recoupment under or as provided by the\nCompany\u2019s plans, awards or employment agreements or the applicable provisions of any law, rule or regulation (including, without limitation,\nSection 10D of the Exchange Act or Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002), or stock exchange listing requirement (and any future\npolicy adopted by the Company pursuant to any such law, rule, regulation or requirement). Any right of recoupment under this Policy is in\naddition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights of recoupment at law or in equity that may be available to the Company.\nAny action or
