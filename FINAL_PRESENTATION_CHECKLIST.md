## üìù TALKING POINTS TO MEMORIZE

### When presenting Olive Garden:
"Olive Garden's 5.9% same-store sales growth significantly outperformed the industry. This was driven by the return of Buy One, Take One for the first time in 5 years, which created urgency and drove a 450 basis point gap versus the industry. Additionally, their digital delivery strategy is capturing younger, more affluent customers with higher check averages."

### When presenting LongHorn:
"LongHorn's 3% traffic growth is remarkable in an environment where most casual dining has negative traffic. They achieved this without heavy promotions, demonstrating the strength of their operational excellence. They rank #1 among major casual dining brands in Technomic's tracking for food quality, service, atmosphere, and value."

### When presenting Fine Dining:
"The -0.2% same-store sales in fine dining reflects the economic sensitivity of the premium segment. However, the $7.6 million average unit volume shows they maintain strong pricing power. The integration of Ruth's Chris and Chuy's is ongoing, and we expect performance to improve as synergies are realized."

### When presenting Bahama Breeze:
"The decision to close 15 Bahama Breeze locations and seek strategic alternatives demonstrates management's portfolio discipline. Rather than continuing to invest in an underperforming brand, they're reallocating resources to higher-return opportunities like LongHorn expansion."

## ‚ùì IF PROFESSOR ASKS...

**"How does Darden grow revenue?"**
‚Üí "Three ways: same-store sales growth averaging 4.7%, new restaurant openings contributing 1-2%, and strategic acquisitions like Ruth's Chris and Chuy's. The mix varies by segment - Olive Garden grows through traffic-driving promotions, LongHorn through balanced traffic and pricing, and fine dining through acquisitions."

**"Why is Darden outperforming Bloomin' Brands?"**
‚Üí "Stronger brand portfolio with Olive Garden as the anchor, better value messaging resonating with consumers, superior digital and delivery execution, and more disciplined portfolio management as evidenced by the Bahama Breeze exit."

**"What are the biggest risks?"**
‚Üí "Segment-specific: beef inflation for LongHorn, promotional dependency for Olive Garden, economic sensitivity for fine dining, and integration execution for recent acquisitions. Overall, the biggest risk is consumer spending pressure in a potentially slowing economy."

**"What's your TTM performance?"**
‚Üí "Trailing twelve months revenue is $12.2 billion, up 0.9% from FY2025, with operating margin of 11.34% and net margin of 8.74%. This reflects the momentum from Q1 FY2026's strong performance."
