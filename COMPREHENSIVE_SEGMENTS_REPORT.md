approachable price points.

existing entrées with reduced portions and a reduced price.

the weekend, still offer abundant portions and come with Olive Garden's never -ending first course of unlimited 
breadsticks and unlimited soup or salad.

The return of Olive Garden's Buy One, Take One offer for the first time in five years, combined with the continued 
strength of off -premise drove their impressive sales during the quarter.

meaningfully communicate strong value, create urgency, and introduce food news continue to resonate as guests 
are motivated by news and compelling price points.

team is doing a great job of staying focused on their strategy and maintaining momentum within the business

- [Q1_FY2026 Earnings Call Transcript.pdf] Was hoping you could give us a breakdown 
on LongHorn, just the comp split between traffic and ticket.

- [Q1_FY2026 Earnings Call Transcript.pdf] So, let's – I'll start with the LongHorn.

- [Q1_FY2026 Earnings Call Transcript.pdf] Traffic was – LongHorn traffic was up about 3.

- [Q1_FY2026 Earnings Call Transcript.pdf] In terms of pricing versus inflation, at 
LongHorn, as we said, we – there was a bigger spike in beef prices.

- [Q1_FY2026 Earnings Call Transcript.pdf] Is that something that 
we could see maybe in a more limited fashion at LongHorn as well, maybe focused on like appetizers or smaller 
plate items? Or is that something that right now is just Olive Garden focused?  
 .

environment, more guests are s eeking price certainty, and Ruth's Chris Steak House introduced a five -week 
limited time offer featuring a three -course menu that drove positive comps for the quarter.

- [Q1_FY2026 Earnings Call Transcript.pdf] While 
same -restaurant sales for the segment were slightly negative, the strong performance of the limited time offer at 
Ruth's Chris helped to offset the continued challenges withi n the Fine Dining category.

- [Q4_FY2025 Earnings Call Transcript.pdf] In addition to Olive Garden and LongHorn, Cheddar's also received an all -time high guest satisfaction score for 
the quarter, as did Ruth's Chris Steak Hou se and Eddie V's.

of Chuy's and Ruth's Chris over the past two years.

- [Q4_FY2025 Earnings Call Transcript.pdf] One of the benefits of the Ruth's Chris acquisition was the scale it added to our franchise b usiness.

- [Q4_FY2025 Earnings Call Transcript.pdf] The increase 
in revenue from adding 74 Ruth's Chris franchise locations has allowed the team to grow faster.

- [Q4_FY2025 Earnings Call Transcript.pdf] We were able to 
add the resources and systems to help our franchisees better operate our brands that would have taken us longer 
if we had not added the Ruth's Chris restaurants, and the team has been busy signing new area development 
agreements with international partners.

## 4. COMPETITOR ANALYSIS

- [Q1_FY2026 Earnings Call Transcript.pdf] To help strengthen their competitive advantage of a socially energized bar, Yard House held its third annual Best 
On Tap competition during the quar ter.

- [Q1_FY2026 Earnings Call Transcript.pdf] And then, just on – I know that there was like some prototypes of like smaller, but then also some 
competitors are saying they're seeing some higher construction costs from like imported stuff.

- [Q4_FY2025 Earnings Call Transcript.pdf] To suppo rt this, during the quarter, Olive Garden validated each one of their grill master's expertise with the 
Eighth Annual Steak Master Series, their internal grilling competition and training program.

- [Q4_FY2025 Earnings Call Transcript.pdf] He said, the greatest edge we have on 
our competitors is the quality of our employees reflected each day in the job they do.

- [Q4_FY2025 Earnings Call Transcript.pdf] And then, just as it relates to your competition on the same front, how do you think the industry is 
thinking about discounting versus prior, whether or not they're comfortable with the elevated levels or whether you 
might see some change there?  
 .

- [Q4_FY2025 10K.pdf] We believe that we provide working conditions and pay and benefits that compare favorably with those of our competitors.

- [Q4_FY2025 10K.pdf] Competition
The restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food, price, service, restaurant location, personnel, brand,
attractiveness of facilities, availability of carryout and home delivery, internet and mobile ordering capabilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing.

- [Q4_FY2025 10K.pdf] We expect intense competition to continue in all of these
areas.

- [Q4_FY2025 10K.pdf] We also may have different or additional competitors for our
intended guests as a result of such a change and may not be able to successfully compete against such competitors.

- [Q4_FY2025 10K.pdf] Even instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food
contamination occurring solely at our competitors’ restaurants, suppliers or distributors (even if we do not work with them) could result in negative publicity
about the food service industry generally and adversely impact our sales.

- [Q4_FY2025 10K.pdf] In
addition, we must effectively respond to changing guest expectations and new technological developments, and if we fail to implement emerging technologies
as quickly and efficiently as our competitors, we may lose guests or employees.

- [Q4_FY2025 10K.pdf] Increased competition and/or
deterioration in business conditions may limit or delay our ability to expand this business.

- [Q4_FY2025 10K.pdf] We face intense competition, and if we have an insufficient strategy or focus on competition and the consumer landscape, our business, financial condition
and results of operations could be adversely affected.

- [Q1 FY2026 Earnings Release Deck.pdf] These	risks	and	uncertainties	include:	a	failure	to	address	cost	pressures	and	a	failure	to	effectively

2.

restaurants, and the addition of 25 net ne w restaurants, which includes the permanent closure of 22

net new restaurants.

includes the permanent c losure of two underperforming restaurants.

- [Q4_FY2025 Earnings Call Transcript.pdf] While the Fine Dining category as a whole 
continues to be challenged, we are seeing sequential improvem ent in guest traffic from households earning 
$150,000 and above.

- [Q4_FY2025 Earnings Call Transcript.pdf] Lookin g at our fiscal 2025 full year P&L, restaurant -level EBITDA grew 40 basis points, driven by disciplined cost 
management and pricing leverage.
